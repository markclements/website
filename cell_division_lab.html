    <b>THE CELL CYCLE</b><strong>, MITOSIS, and MEIOSIS</strong>
    <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
    <p>In this laboratory, you will investigate the process of mitosis
      and meiosis. The first part is a study of mitosis. You will use
      prepared slides of onion root tips to study plant mitosis and to
      calculate the relative duration of the phases of mitosis in the
      meristem of root tissue. Prepared slides of the whitefish blastula
      may be used to study mitosis in animal cells and to compare animal
      mitosis with plant mitosis.</p>
    <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></p>
    <p>All new cells come from previously existing cells. New cells are
      formed by the process of cell division which involves both
      replication of the cell's nucleus (<strong>karyokinesis</strong>)
      and division of the cytoplasm (<strong>cytokinesis</strong>). It
      is imperative that the DNA be moved in an extremely efficient
      manner during division. If the DNA were to be moved in a way that
      jeopardizes the integrity of it's code the resulting cells would
      have defective information that would likely lead to the new cells
      death. Biologists have been amazed by the beauty and accuracy of
      cell division. The preparations made by the cell in advance of and
      during division required millions of years to perfect. Without the
      many intricate steps that occur during division the chance of
      growth without disease is all but impossible. It has been
      demonstrated in many experiments that certain chemical substances,
      both legal as well as illegal, disrupt one or more of these
      intricate processes and results in either cell death or the
      formation of defective cells.</p>
    <p>There are two types of nuclear division: mitosis and meiosis. <strong>Mitosis</strong>
      typically results in new somatic (body) cells. Formation of an
      adult organism from a fertilized egg, asexual reproduction,
      regeneration, and maintenance or repair of body parts are
      accomplished through mitotic cell division. <strong>Meiosis</strong>
      results in the formation of specialized reproductive cells, either
      gametes (in animals) or spores (in plants). These cells have half
      the chromosome number of the parent cell. You will study meiosis
      in Exercise 3B.</p>
    <p>Use the posters in the lab to become more familiar with the
      phases mitosis before you begin exercise 3A.1.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>EXERCISE 3A.1: Observing Mitosis in Plant and Animal
        Cells Using Prepared Slides of the Onion Root Tip and Whitefish
        Blastula</strong></p>
    <p>Where does one find cells undergoing mitosis? Plants and animals
      differ in this respect. In plants the process of forming new cells
      is restricted to special growth regions called <strong>meristems</strong>.
      These regions usually occur at the tips of stems or roots (growth
      in length) and in many is also found in a circular band of the
      stem allowing secondary growth (growth in width). In animals, cell
      division occurs anywhere new cells are formed or as new cells
      replace old ones. However, some tissues in both plants and animals
      rarely divide once the organism or tissue is mature (ie: vascular
      tissues in plants, brain neurons in animals).</p>
    <p>To study the stages of mitosis, you need to look for tissues
      where there are many cells in the process of mitosis. This
      restricts your search to the tips of growing plants such as the
      onion root tip or, in the case of animals, to rapidly dividing
      tissue such as developing embryos.</p>
    <p>Roots consist of different regions. The <strong>root cap</strong>
      functions in protection. The <strong>apical meristem</strong> is
      the region that contains the highest percentage of cells
      undergoing mitosis. The <strong>region of elongation</strong> is
      the area in which growth occurs. The <strong>region of maturation</strong>
      is where root hairs develop and where cells differentiate to
      become xylem, phloem, and other tissues (Figure 3.1)</p>

    <p>Cells of the Apical Meristem Close up.</p>
    <p>The whitefish blastula is excellent for the study of cell
      division. It is a spherical mass of cells that represents a stage
      in the development of most animals. As soon as the egg is
      fertilized it begins to divide, and nuclear division after nuclear
      division follows. You will be provided with a slide that contains
      many whitefish blastula which have been sectioned in various
      planes in relation to the mitotic spindle. You will be able to see
      side and polar view of the spindle apparatus.

      <br>
      Cells of the Whitefish Blastula close up</p>
    <p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>
    <p>Examine prepared slides of either the onion root tips or
      whitefish blastulas. If using the onion root tip be sure to locate
      the meristematic region of the onion root tip to find all the
      various stages of the cell cycle (see image above). Looking at 2
      or more whitefish blastulas will likely be needed to reveal every
      stage in the cell cycle as well.</p>
    <p>In both cases start with the 10X objective first, locate the
      blastula or the meristematic region of the root tip, and then use
      the 40X objective to study individual cells. The cells in the root
      tip will be clearly defined while the cells in the blastula may be
      a bit faint. In either case, the stained DNA will be very obvious
      and enable you to identify the specific stages in the cell cycle.
      For convenience in discussion, biologists have described certain
      stages, or phases, of the continuous mitotic cell cycle, as
      outlined below. Attempt to locate at least one cell which clearly
      represents each phase.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The nondividing cell is in a stage called <strong>interphase</strong>.
        The<strong> nucleus </strong>may have one or more dark-stained
        <strong>nucleoli</strong> and is filled with a fine network of
        threads, the <strong>chromatin</strong>. During <strong>interphase</strong>,
        DNA replication occurs. Interphase is actually divided into
        three different stages. <br>
        G1 - first growth phase. increasing organelle content of cell<br>
        S - synthesis of more DNA (replication)<br>
        G2 - second growth phase, forming specific cytoplasmic
        structures needed for mitosis &amp; cytokinesis<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>The first sign of division occurs in <strong>prophase</strong>.
        There is a thickening of the chromatin threads, which continues
        until it is evident that the chromatin has condensed into<strong>
          chromosomes</strong>. With somewhat higher magnification you
        may be able to see that each chromosome is composed of two <strong>chromatids</strong>
        joined at a <strong>centromere</strong>. As prophase continues,
        the chromatids continue to shorten and thicken. In late prophase
        the nuclear envelope and nucleoli are no longer visible, and the
        chromosomes are free in the cytoplasm. Just before this time the
        first sign of a spindle appear in the cytoplasm; the spindle
        apparatus is made up of <strong>microtubules</strong>, and it
        is thought that these microtubules may pull the chromosomes
        toward the poles of the cell where the two daughter nuclei will
        eventually form.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>In <strong>prometaphase</strong> the nuclear membrane has
        completely broken down and disappeared and the spindle fibers
        have connected to the kinetochore located at the centromere. The
        chromosomes then begin to move in an agitated fashion as they
        are prepared for alignment in the middle of the cell
        (metaphase). Distinguishing cells that are in prometaphase will
        be difficult and can only be based on no nuclear membrane and
        clearly defined chromosomes NOT lined up at the equator of the
        cell. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>At <strong>metaphase</strong>, the chromosomes have moved to
        the center of the spindle. One particular portion of each
        chromosome, the centromere, attaches to the spindle. The
        centromeres of all the chromosomes lie at about the same level
        of the spindle, on a plane called the metaphase plate. At
        metaphase you should be able to observe the two chromatids of
        some of the chromosomes. <br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li>A the beginning of <strong>anaphase</strong>, the centromere
        regions of each pair of chromatids separate and the identical
        copies of DNA are moved by the spindle fibers toward opposite
        poles of the spindle. Once the two chromatids separate, each is
        called a chromosome. All the daughter chromosomes continue to be
        pulled toward one pole or the other until they form two compact
        clumps, one at each spindle pole.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Telophase</strong>; the last stage of division is
        marked by a pronounced de condensation of the chromosomes,
        followed by the formation of a new nuclear envelope around each
        mass of chromosomes. The chromosomes gradually uncoil to form
        the fine chromatin network seen in interphase, and the nucleoli
        and nuclear envelope reappear. <strong>Cytokinesis</strong> may
        occur. This is the division of the cytoplasm into two cells. In
        plants, vesicles begin to collect and fuse in the middle of the
        cell followed by a new cell wall being laid down between the
        daughter cells. In animal cells, the old cell will pinch off in
        the middle forming a <strong>cleavage furrow</strong> which
        splits the parent cell into two new daughter cells</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong><br>
      </strong></p>
    <h2>MITOSIS</h2>
    <p><strong>QUESTION:</strong>What is the approximate time it takes
      for Interphase and the various phases of Mitosis to be completed
      in an onion root tip or white fish blastula?</p>
    <p><strong>HYPOTHESIS:</strong> (State it here in your own words)<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
    <p>To estimate the relative length of time that a cell spends in the
      various stages of cell replication, you will examine the
      meristematic region of a prepared slide of the onion root tip. The
      length of the cell cycle is approximately 24 hours or 1440 minutes
      for cells in actively dividing onion root tips. The length of the
      cell cycle in a whitefish blastula is approximately 600 minutes.</p>
    <p><strong>PROCEDURE</strong></p>
    <p>It is hard to imagine that you can estimate how much time a cell
      spends in each phase of cell replication from a slide of dead
      cells. yet this is precisely what you will do in this part of the
      lab. Since you are working with a prepared slide, you cannot get
      any information about how long it takes a cell to divide. What you
      can determine is how many cells are in each phase. From this, you
      can infer the percent of time each cells spends in each phase.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In an onion root tip slide observe every cell in one high
        power field of view (50 or more cells) and determine which phase
        of the cell cycle it is in. This is best done in pairs. The
        partner observing the slide calls out the phase of each cell
        while the other partner records. Then switch so the recorder
        becomes the observer and vice versa. View the cells in columns
        and simply count the various stages as you move down the rows.
        Count at least two full fields of view. If you have not counted
        at least 200 cells, then count a third field of view.</li>
      <li>Record your data in a Table like the one shown below</li>

      fish blastula,<br>
      calculate the amount of time spent in each phase of the cell cycle
      from the percent of cells in that stage.</p>

    <h2>Meiosis Activity</h2>
    <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
    <p>Every year students think they have a handle on what takes place
      in Meiosis and every year they find out that they are severely
      lacking in a working understanding of the process when they take
      the unit exam. Modeling the process will significantly help you
      understand what is going on.<br>
      <br>
      Meiosis involves two successive nuclear divisions that produce
      four haploid (one of each chromosome - half the diploid number)
      cells. Meiosis I is the reduction division. It is this first
      division that reduces the chromosome number from diploid to
      haploid and separates the homologous pairs (not the sister
      chromatids). Meiosis II, the second division, separates the sister
      chromatids. The result is four haploid gametes.</p>
    <p>Mitotic cell division produces new cells genetically identical to
      the parent cell. Meiosis makes sexual reproduction possible
      without increasing ploidy and supports increases in genetic
      variation in the population. Each diploid cell undergoing meiosis
      can Produce 2<sup>n</sup> different chromosomal combinations,
      where n is the haploid number. In humans the number of is 2 <sup>23</sup>,
      which is more than eight million different combinations. Actually,
      the potential variation is even greater than this value. During
      meiosis I, each pair of chromosomes (homologous chromosomes) comes
      together in a process known as synapsis. Chromatids of homologous
      chromosomes may exchange parts in a process called <strong>Crossing
        Over</strong>. The relative distance between two genes on a
      given chromosome can be estimated by calculating the percentage of
      crossing over that takes place between them.</p>
    <h3><br>
      Meiosis Simulation:</h3>
    <p>In this exercise you will study the process of meiosis using
      Pop-It Beads. You will use these beads to create a diploid cell
      containing two pairs of chromosomes. There are two colors so that
      one maybe used to represent <strong>Paternal DNA</strong> and the
      other color used to represent <strong>Maternal DNA</strong>.</p>
    <p>Create two strands of beads of each color that are 14 beads long
      (this will form a total of four chains two of each color and all
      are 14 beads long). Place the magnet or the white connect it bead
      (multiple holes on bead) after the fifth bead on the strand to
      represent the <strong>centromere</strong> (a collection of
      proteins that hold sister chromatids together and the motor
      proteins needed to walk along the spindle fiber).</p>
    <p>Create two additional strands of beads of each color that are 8
      beads long (this will form a total of four chains two of each
      color and all are 8 beads long). Place the magnet or the white
      connect it bead (multiple holes on bead) after the third bead on
      the strand to represent the <strong>centromere</strong> (a
      collection of proteins that hold sister chromatids together and
      the motor proteins needed to walk along the spindle fiber). You
      should now have a total of 8 strands of beads created, two long
      and two short of each color.</p>
    <p>A diploid cell contains homologous pair of chromosomes, or in
      other words 2 of each type (length) of DNA. One came from the
      paternal side and the other from the maternal. is represented by
      one strand of each color, with one of each pair coming from each
      parent. The second strands of each color are to be used as
      chromatids for each of these chromosomes.</p>
    <p>Interphase. Place one strand of each color near the center of
      your work area. (Recall that chromosomes at this stage would exist
      as diffuse chromatin and not as visible structures.) DNA synthesis
      occurs during interphase and each chromosome, originally composed
      of one strand, is now made up of two strands, or chromatids,
      joined together at the centromere region. Simulate DNA replication
      by bringing the magnetic centromere region of one strand in
      contact with the centromere region of the other of the same color.
      Do the same with its homolog (Figure 3.4).</p>
    <p><strong>Interphase</strong>: Place one strand of each color near
      the center of your work area. In interphase recall that the DNA is
      relaxed and in the form of threadlike <strong>Chromatin</strong>.
      (We will be unable to model the chromatin phase but can simulate
      what happens to the total number of DNA molecules) DNA synthesis
      occurs during Interphase (S-stage). At the conclusion of the S
      stage each strand of DNA has bee copied (<strong>Replication</strong>)
      and when chromosomes are formed in Prophase they will be actually
      double stranded (Two identical DNA chains). Each strand is called
      a <strong>Chromatid</strong> and they are held together by a mass
      of protein called the <strong>Centromere</strong>. Simulate DNA
      replication by bringing the magnetic centromere region of one
      strand in contact with the centromere region of the other of the
      same color. Do the same with its homolog as well as the second
      pair of homologs (different length).</p>
    <p>Summary: DNA Replication</p>
    <p><img src="homologues.jpg"></p>
    <p><strong>Prophase I</strong>: Homologous chromosomes come together
      and synapse along their entire length. Synapsis does not occur in
      mitosis and therefore this is the first big difference between
      Mitosis &amp; Meiosis.. (In MITOSIS homologous chromosomes line up
      independently of one another). In MEIOSIS, as a result of synapsis
      of homologs, a <strong>Tetrad</strong> is formed consisting of
      four chromatids. It is during synapsis that the strands of two
      homologs intertwine and exchange sections. This event is called
      crossing over which is a common occurrence. Entwine the two
      chromosomes to simulate synapsis and the process of crossing over.
      Crossing Over can be simulated by popping some beads apart on one
      chromatid at the fifth bead or "Gene" and doing the same with the
      other chromatid. Reconnect the beads to those of the other color.
      Proceed through Prophase I of meiosis and note how crossing over
      results in recombination of genetic information.</p>

    <p><strong>Anaphase I</strong></p>
    <p>During Anaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are separated and
      pulled to opposite sides of the cell. This represents a second
      significant difference between the events of mitosis and meiosis.</p>

    <p><strong>Telophase I:</strong>Place each chromosome at opposite
      sides of the cell. Centriole duplication is completed in Telophase
      in preparation for the next division. Formation of a nuclear
      envelope and division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) often occur
      at the same time to produce two cells, but this is always not the
      case. Some cells are large and depend upon many nuclei to control
      metabolism (cardiac muscle cells). In their case Mitosis can occur
      that is not accompanied by cytokinesis. Notice in your simulated
      cell that each chromosome within the two daughter cells still
      consists of two chromatids.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Summary:Two Haploid Cells Formed, each chromosome composed of two
      chromatids</p>

    <h2>Meiosis II</h2>
    <p>A second meiotic division is necessary to separate the chromatids
      of the chromosomes in the two daughter cells formed by the first
      division. This will reduce the amount of DNA to one strand
      (chromatid) per chromosome. This second division is called Meiosis
      II. It resembles mitosis except that it begins with only one
      homolog from each homologous pair of chromosomes.</p>
    <p>The following simulation procedures apply to haploid nuclei
      produced from Meiosis I.</p>
    <p>Interphase II (<strong>Interkinesis</strong>): The amount of time
      spent "at rest" following telophase I depends upon the type of
      organism which will impact the formation of new nuclear envelopes,
      and the degree of chromosomal uncoiling. Because Interphase II
      does not necessarily resemble Interphase I, it is often given a
      different name -<strong></strong>interkinesis. DNA replication
      does not occur during Interkinesis. This represents the Third
      difference between mitosis &amp; meiosis.</p>
    <p><strong>Prophase II:</strong> No DNA replication occurs.
      replicated centrioles (not shown) move to opposite sides of the
      cell. Double stranded chromosomes formed during Meiosis I become
      attached to the developing spindle fibers.</p>
    <p>Summary: nuclear envelope disappears, chromatids condense to
      chromosomes, centrioles move to opposite sides, spindle attaches
      to centromere of chromosomes.</p>

    <p><strong>Telophase II</strong>: After the single chromatids have
      reached the opposite sides of the cell a nuclear envelope is
      reformed, spindle fibers break down, chromosomal DNA uncoils and
      forms chromatin, the cytoplasm divides and cleaves the cell into
      two separate cells each having one of each type of chromosome.</p>

    <p>Before moving on to the analysis questions use the pop it beads
      to construct four single stranded chromosomes. Use one homologous
      pair to represent a cell going through mitosis use the other
      homologous pair to represent a cell going through meiosis. Move
      the beaded chromosome models to simulate mitosis in the one cell
      and meiosis in the other. Compare the two and look for major
      differences.</p>
    <h2 align="left">Analysis &amp; Investigation</h2>
    <p>1. List three major differences between the events of Mitosis
      &amp; Meiosis.</p>
    <p>2. Compare mitosis and meiosis with respect to each of the
      following.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Mitosis</p>
    <p>Meiosis</p>
    <p>Chromosome number of <br>
      parent cell</p>
    <p>Number of DNA <br>
      Replications</p>
    <p>Number of Divisions<br>
    </p>
    <p>Number of Daughter cells<br>
      produced</p>
    <p>Chromosome number in <br>
      daughter cells</p>
    <p>Number of genetically<br>
      unique daughter cells</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Purpose of division<br>
    </p>
    <p>3. How are meiosis I and Meiosis II different?</p>
    <p>4.Why is meiosis important for sexual reproduction?</p>
    <p>5. Why doesn't "crossing" over occur in Mitosis?</p>
