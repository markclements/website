      Mendel's principles of inheritance form the cornerstone of modern
      genetics. So just what are they?</h2>
    <p><br>
      Ever wonder why you are the only one in your family with your
      grandfather's nose? The way in which traits are passed from one
      generation to the next-and sometimes skip generations-was first
      explained by Gregor Mendel. By experimenting with pea plant
      breeding, Mendel developed three principles of inheritance that
      described the transmission of genetic traits, before anyone knew
      genes existed. Mendel's insight greatly expanded the understanding
      of genetic inheritance, and led to the development of new
      experimental methods.</p>
    <p>Traits are passed down in families in different patterns.
      Pedigrees can illustrate these patterns by following the history
      of specific characteristics, or phenotypes, as they appear in a
      family. For example, the pedigree in Figure 1 shows a family in
      which a grandmother (generation I) has passed down a
      characteristic (shown in solid red) through the family tree. The
      inheritance pattern of this characteristic is considered dominant,
      because it is observable in every generation. Thus, every
      individual who carries the genetic code for this characteristic
      will show evidence of the characteristic. In contrast, Figure 2
      shows a different pattern of inheritance, in which a
      characteristic disappears in one generation, only to reappear in a
      subsequent one. This pattern of inheritance, in which the parents
      do not show the phenotype but some of the children do, is
      considered <a

        Mendel’s Courage and Persistence</strong></h2>
    <p>Our modern understanding of how traits may be inherited through
      generations comes from the principles proposed by Gregor Mendel in
      1865. However, Mendel didn't discover these foundational
      principles of inheritance by studying human beings, but rather by
      studying <em>Pisum sativum</em>, or the common pea plant. Indeed,
      after eight years of tedious experiments with these plants, and—by
      his own admission—"some courage" to persist with them, Mendel
      proposed three foundational principles of inheritance. These
      principles eventually assisted clinicians in human disease
      research; for example, within just a couple of years of the
      rediscovery of Mendel's work, <a
        href="http://www.esp.org/foundations/genetics/classical/ag-02.pdf"
        title="Archibald Garrod applied Mendel's principles to his study
        of alkaptonuria">Archibald Garrod applied Mendel's principles to
        his study of alkaptonuria</a>. Today, whether you are talking
      about pea plants or human beings, genetic traits that follow the
      rules of inheritance that Mendel proposed are called Mendelian.</p>
    <p>Mendel was curious about how traits were transferred from one
      generation to the next, so he set out to understand the principles
      of heredity in the mid-1860s. Peas were a good model system,
      because he could easily control their fertilization by
      transferring pollen with a small paintbrush. This pollen could
      come from the same flower (self-fertilization), or it could come
      from another plant's flowers (cross-fertilization). First, Mendel
      observed plant forms and their offspring for two years as they
      self-fertilized, or "selfed," and ensured that their outward,
      measurable characteristics remained constant in each generation.
      During this time, Mendel observed seven different characteristics
      in the pea plants, and each of these characteristics had two forms
      (Figure 3). The characteristics included height (tall or short),
      pod shape (inflated or constricted), seed shape (smooth or
      winkled), pea color (green or yellow), and so on. In the years
      Mendel spent letting the plants self, he verified the purity of
      his plants by confirming, for example, that tall plants had only
      tall children and grandchildren and so forth. Because the seven
      pea plant characteristics tracked by Mendel were consistent in
      generation after generation of self-fertilization, these parental
      lines of peas could be considered pure-breeders (or, in modern
      terminology, homozygous for the traits of interest). Mendel and
      his assistants eventually developed 22 varieties of pea plants
      with combinations of these consistent characteristics.</p>

        plants grown from the seeds."><figcaption>Figure 3 : Mendel used

    </figure>
    <p>Mendel not only crossed pure-breeding parents, but he also
      crossed hybrid generations and crossed the hybrid progeny back to
      both parental lines. These crosses (which, in modern terminology,
      are referred to as F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>1</sub> reciprocal, F<sub>2</sub>,
      B<sub>1</sub>, and B<sub>2</sub>) are the classic crosses to
      generate genetically hybrid generations.</p>
    <h2 id="understanding-dominant-traits"><strong>Understanding
        Dominant Traits</strong></h2>
    <p>Before Mendel's experiments, most people believed that traits in
      offspring resulted from a blending of the traits of each parent.
      However, when Mendel cross-pollinated one variety of purebred
      plant with another, these crosses would yield offspring that
      looked like either one of the parent plants, not a blend of the
      two. For example, when Mendel cross-fertilized plants with
      wrinkled seeds to those with smooth seeds, he did not get progeny
      with semi-wrinkly seeds. Instead, the progeny from this cross had
      only smooth seeds. In general, if the progeny of crosses between
      purebred plants looked like only one of the parents with regard to
      a specific trait, Mendel called the expressed parental trait the
      dominant trait. From this simple observation, Mendel proposed his
      first principle, the principle of uniformity; this principle
      states that all the progeny of a cross like this (where the
      parents differ by only one trait) will appear identical.
      Exceptions to the principle of uniformity include the phenomena of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetrance"

        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivity"

        title="sex-linkage">sex-linkage</a>, which were discovered after
      Mendel's time.</p>
    <h2 id="understanding-recessive-traits"><strong>Understanding
        Recessive Traits</strong></h2>
    <p>When conducting his experiments, Mendel designated the two
      pure-breeding parental generations involved in a particular cross
      as P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>, and he then denoted the
      progeny resulting from the crossing as the filial, or F<sub>1</sub>,
      generation. Although the plants of the F<sub>1</sub> generation
      looked like one parent of the P generation, they were actually
      hybrids of two different parent plants. Upon observing the
      uniformity of the F<sub>1</sub> generation, Mendel wondered
      whether the F<sub>1</sub> generation could still possess the
      nondominant traits of the other parent in some hidden way.</p>
    <p>To understand whether traits were hidden in the F<sub>1</sub>
      generation, Mendel returned to the method of self-fertilization.
      Here, he created an F<sub>2</sub> generation by letting an F<sub>1</sub>
      pea plant self-fertilize (F<sub>1</sub> x F<sub>1</sub>). This
      way, he knew he was crossing two plants of the exact same
      genotype. This technique, which involves looking at a single
      trait, is today called a monohybrid cross. The resulting F<sub>2</sub>
      generation had seeds that were either round or wrinkled. Figure 4
      shows an example of Mendel's data.</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./img/pierce_3_3_FULL.jpg" alt="Figure 4 : Mendel
        conducted monohybrid crosses." width="472" height="927"><figcaption>Figure
        4 : Mendel conducted monohybrid crosses.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>When looking at the figure, notice that for each F<sub>1</sub>
      plant, the self-fertilization resulted in more round than wrinkled
      seeds among the F<sub>2</sub> progeny. These results illustrate
      several important aspects of scientific data:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>Multiple trials are necessary to see patterns in experimental
        data.</li>
      <li>There is a lot of variation in the measurements of one
        experiment.</li>
      <li>A large sample size, or "N," is required to make any
        quantitative comparisons or conclusions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In Figure 4, the result of Experiment 1 shows that the single
      characteristic of seed shape was expressed in two different forms
      in the F<sub>2</sub>generation: either round or wrinkled. Also,
      when Mendel averaged the relative proportion of round and wrinkled
      seeds across all F<sub>2</sub>progeny sets, he found that round
      was consistently three times more frequent than wrinkled. This 3:1
      proportion resulting from F<sub>1</sub> x F<sub>1</sub>crosses
      suggested there was a hidden recessive form of the trait. Mendel
      recognized that this recessive trait was carried down to the F<sub>2</sub>
      generation from the earlier P generation.</p>
    <h2 id="mendel-and-alleles"><strong>Mendel and Alleles</strong></h2>
    <p>As mentioned, Mendel's data did not support the ideas about trait
      blending that were popular among the biologists of his time. As
      there were never any semi-wrinkled seeds or greenish-yellow seeds,
      for example, in the F<sub>2</sub> generation, Mendel concluded
      that blending should not be the expected outcome of parental trait
      combinations. Mendel instead hypothesized that each parent
      contributes some particulate matter to the offspring. He called
      this heritable substance "elementen." (Remember, in 1865, Mendel
      did not know about DNA or genes.) Indeed, for each of the traits
      he examined, Mendel focused on how the elementen that determined
      that trait was distributed among progeny. We now know that a
      single gene controls seed form, while another controls color, and
      so on, and that elementen is actually the assembly of physical
      genes located on chromosomes. Multiple forms of those genes, known
      as alleles, represent the different traits. For example, one
      allele results in round seeds, and another allele specifies
      wrinkled seeds.</p>
    <p>One of the most impressive things about Mendel's thinking lies in
      the notation that he used to represent his data. Mendel's notation
      of a capital and a lowercase letter (<em>Aa</em>) for the hybrid
      genotype actually represented what we now know as the two alleles
      of one gene:<em>A</em> and <em>a</em>. Moreover, as previously
      mentioned, in all cases, Mendel saw approximately a 3:1 ratio of
      one phenotype to another. When one parent carried all the dominant
      traits (<em>AA</em>), the F<sub>1</sub> hybrids were
      "indistinguishable" from that parent. However, even though these F<sub>1</sub>
      plants had the same phenotype as the dominant P<sub>1</sub>
      parents, they possessed a hybrid genotype (<em>Aa</em>) that
      carried the potential to look like the recessive P<sub>1</sub>
      parent (<em>aa</em>). After observing this potential to express a
      trait without showing the phenotype, Mendel put forth his second
      principle of inheritance: the principle of segregation. According
      to this principle, the "particles" (or alleles as we now know
      them) that determine traits are separated into gametes during
      meiosis, and meiosis produces equal numbers of egg or sperm cells
      that contain each allele (Figure 5).</p>
    <figure>
      <img src="./img/pierce_3_4.jpg" alt="Figure 5: Mendel's monohybrid
        crosses revealed the principle of segregation and the concept of
        dominance."><figcaption>Figure 5: Mendel's monohybrid crosses
        revealed the principle of segregation and the concept of
        dominance.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h2 id="dihybrid-crosses"><strong>Dihybrid Crosses</strong></h2>
    <p>Mendel had thus determined what happens when two plants that are
      hybrid for one trait are crossed with each other, but he also
      wanted to determine what happens when two plants that are each
      hybrid for two traits are crossed. Mendel therefore decided to
      examine the inheritance of two characteristics at once. Based on
      the concept of segregation, he predicted that traits must sort
      into gametes separately. By extrapolating from his earlier data,
      Mendel also predicted that the inheritance of one characteristic
      did not affect the inheritance of a different characteristic.</p>
    <p>Mendel tested this idea of trait independence with more complex
      crosses. First, he generated plants that were purebred for two
      characteristics, such as seed color (yellow and green) and seed
      shape (round and wrinkled). These plants would serve as the P<sub>1</sub>
      generation for the experiment. In this case, Mendel crossed the
      plants with wrinkled and yellow seeds (<em>rrYY</em>) with plants
      with round, green seeds (<em>RRyy</em>). From his earlier
      monohybrid crosses, Mendel knew which traits were dominant: round
      and yellow. So, in the F<sub>1</sub> generation, he expected all
      round, yellow seeds from crossing these purebred varieties, and
      that is exactly what he observed. Mendel knew that each of the F<sub>1</sub>
      progeny were dihybrids; in other words, they contained both
      alleles for each characteristic (<em>RrYy</em>). He then crossed
      individual F<sub>1</sub> plants (with genotypes <em>RrYy</em>)
      with one another. This is called a dihybrid cross. Mendel's
      results from this cross were as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>315 plants with round, yellow seeds</li>
      <li>108 plants with round, green seeds</li>
      <li>101 plants with wrinkled, yellow seeds</li>
      <li>32 plants with wrinkled, green seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Thus, the various phenotypes were present in a 9:3:3:1 ratio
      (Figure 6).</p>

        revealed the principle of independent assortment.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Next, Mendel went through his data and examined each
      characteristic separately. He compared the total numbers of round
      versus wrinkled and yellow versus green peas, as shown in Tables 1
      and 2.</p>

      The proportion of each trait was still approximately 3:1 for both
      seed shape and seed color. In other words, the resulting seed
      shape and seed color looked as if they had come from two parallel
      monohybrid crosses; even though two characteristics were involved
      in one cross, these traits behaved as though they had segregated
      independently. From these data, Mendel developed the third
      principle of inheritance: the principle of independent assortment.
      According to this principle, alleles at one locus segregate into
      gametes independently of alleles at other loci. Such gametes are
      formed in equal frequencies.</p>

    <h2 id="mendels-legacy"><strong>Mendel’s Legacy</strong></h2>
    <p>More lasting than the pea data Mendel presented in 1862 has been
      his methodical hypothesis testing and careful application of
      mathematical models to the study of biological inheritance. From
      his first experiments with monohybrid crosses, Mendel formed
      statistical predictions about trait inheritance that he could test
      with more complex experiments of dihybrid and even trihybrid
      crosses. This method of developing statistical expectations about
      inheritance data is one of the most significant contributions
      Mendel made to biology.</p>
    <p>But do all organisms pass their on genes in the same way as the
      garden pea plant? The answer to that question is no, but many
      organisms do indeed show inheritance patterns similar to the
      seminal ones described by Mendel in the pea. In fact, the three
      principles of inheritance that Mendel laid out have had far
      greater impact than his original data from pea plant
      manipulations. To this day, scientists use Mendel's principles to
      explain the most basic phenomena of inheritance.</p>
