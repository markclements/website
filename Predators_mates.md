###Predators & sexual selection

* * * * *

Of course, which traits are successful and which are not are determined
in large part by the organism’s lifestyle and its ecological niche –
basically how and where it makes its living and how it reproduces. 

Each species is part of the environment of other species. Changes in one
species can have dramatic impacts on the evolution of others.

said to Alice … “Here, you see, it takes all the running you can do to
keep in the same place” -Though the Looking Glass by Lewis Carroll*

An obvious example is the interrelationship between predators, pathogens
and prey. Which organisms survive to reproduce will be determined in
large part by their ability to avoid their predators or recover from
infection. 

Certain traits may make the prey less likely to avoid, elude, repulse,
discourage or escape a predator’s attack. 

As the prey population evolves in response to a specific predator, these
changes will impact the predator – they will also have to adapt. 

The same type of evolutionary interplay occurs between pathogens and
hosts, although the effects are more difficult to read in the fossil
record.

Over time, as species appear and disappear, the selective landscape changes and populations 
of organisms are subject to different selective pressures.

**Sexual selection**: There is another type of selection, known as
[sexual
selection.](http://www.mscok.edu/%7Ebstewart/bstewart/classes/zoology/sexselec.htm)
The importance of sexual selection was first recognized by Darwin in his
book "[The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to
Sex](http://www.zoo.uib.no/classics/darwin/descent.chap8.txt)". 

Sexual organisms often do not mate randomly, and generally the larger
parental investment in the production and rearing of offspring, the less
random is mating [[the evolution of love
link](http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2012-05/1336600952.Ev.r.html)].

In many types of organisms, and most vertebrates, females (the sex that
produces the larger gametes) either choose their mating partners or
males (the sex that produces the smaller gametes) contend with one
another to control access to females. Under some conditions, females
also compete with other females for access to males, particularly when
male partnering makes a significant contribution to reproductive
success.

Why is this? From the female’s perspective, generating offspring
involves a serious commitment of resources

Consider human pregnancy as an example. A female can have at most one
pregnancy a year, while a male could (in theory at least) make a rather
large number of females pregnant.  

Moreover, the biological cost of generating offspring is generally
substantially greater for the female, compared to the male. 

So, if the female is going to have offspring, it would be in their
evolutionary interest that those offspring survive and reproduce. 

The more robust the mate, the more likely that the offspring will be
genetically “well endowed” and likely to survive and reproduce, that is,
the greater the return on the female’s substantial investment.  

At the same time, the survival of offspring can be increased by the
continued presence of the male, to protect the female and its (and
their) offspring.

In many species the male’s “investment” in the next generation is much
less substantial.

Males can often maximize their reproductive success by mating with
multiple females, or in some species, by helping the female to
successfully produce and raise offspring.

Both males and females “know” these rules and may attempt to deceive
each another.

A male may appear more robust than he actually is, [a female may mate
with multiple
males](http://www.research-projects.unizh.ch/math/unit72101/area155/p4296.htm)in
order to select the most robust sperm ([sperm
selection](http://www.funpecrp.com.br/gmr/year2002/vol3-1/gmr0034_abstract.htm)),
or may mate with one male and bond with another, so that the second can
help with raising the offspring.

In turn, males may respond by attempting to monopolize the female. This,
of course, will require the male to spend energy in “guarding”.

There are many variations to be found in [the natural
world](http://ib.berkeley.edu/courses/ib160/past_papers/suttle.html) and
a full discussion is beyond the scope of this course.

Sexual selection can lead to seemingly maladaptive traits. Consider the
peacock’s tail.  It takes a continuous supply of energy to generate a
large, symmetrical and colorful tail.  It can also make the male more
vulnerable to predators.

On the other hand, the presence of a gaudy tail implies that its owner
is able to successfully compete with others for resources, and so is
likely to be genetically “well endowed”.

Once females notice tail size as a marker of success, they select as
mates those males with the largest and most attractive tails.

This can lead to runaway’ selection, the more prominent the male’s tail
the more likely he will find a mate, even though it may also have
negative effects.  For example, the development of extremely large
antlers, associated with male dominance and mate accessibility, as
occurred in [*Megaloceros giganteous*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_elk), can inhibit their ability to move
through heavily wooded areas.

As their environment changed, their behavior and phenotypes could act to
limit their ability to adapt fast enough to avoid extinction.

In the end, as with all adaptations, there is a balance between the
positive effects, which lead to increased reproductive success (such as
access to mates) and their negative effects, which can influence
survival. 

The optimal form of a trait may not be stable over time, particularly if
the environment is changing.

**Questions to answer**

1.  How does the adaptation of a prey species to the presence of a
    predator/pathogen influence the evolution of the predator/pathogen? 
2.  What does it mean to cheat, in terms of sexual selection - is the
    “cheating” organism actually being consciously deceptive?
3.  What types of “cheating” behavior do females use with males; or
    males with females?
4.  What are the costs involved when a male tries to monopolize one or
    more females? what are the advantages?
5.  What limits “runaway selection”?

**Questions to ponder**

-   Is Devendra Singh right about “mating budgets”?
-   Read: [sexual cannibalism](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/profile-maydianne-andrade.html)
    & [this can’t be
    love](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/05/science/05cann.html): how
    are such behaviors ever selected?
