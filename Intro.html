<h3 id="a-brief-introduction-to-biology">A (Brief) Introduction to Biology:</h3>
<hr />
<p>Biological systems (i.e., humans, fishes, butterflies, bacteria, plants, and all of the other living “things” on this planet) are <strong>physicochemical systems</strong> with a history shaped by evolutionary processes over billions of years. Even processes as amazing as dreaming and laughing are based on natural phenomena governed by the laws of physics and chemistry. This is a good thing for biologists, it allow theses processes to be studied scientifically.</p>
<p>Cells are the smallest living units on this planet. All living “things” are composed of cells. These living “things” or what biologists call organisms. If you were lucky enough to discover a new organism and it was not extraterrestrial, it would most likely be made of one or more cells.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_theory">Cell Theory</a> holds that all cells are derived from pre-existing cells. It does not speak to where the original cells came from. The simplest organisms consist of a single cell; you are a multicellular organism made of many trillions of distinct cells. Organisms, like you and other lifeforms, are <strong>non-equilibrium</strong>, <strong>homeostatic</strong>, and <strong>adaptive</strong> self-replicating systems.</p>
<p>Based on the fossil record and comparison of cellular and molecular-level similarities of living organisms, it appears that all organisms now living on earth are derived from a common (shared) ancestor, known as the &quot;last universal common ancestor&quot; (<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v465/n7295/pdf/nature09014.pdf">LUCA</a>), which lived between 3.5 to 3.8 billion years ago.</p>

<p>Since then, cells (and organisms) have been formed from pre-existing cells (and organisms), through an unbroken tree of life. There was a single origin of life on this planet. This is just one of many strange scientific conclusions <a href="http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/asbmbtoday_article_print.aspx?id=13071">strange scientific conclusions</a>.</p>
<p>The diversity of organisms that exist and have existed on this planet were generated by processes of evolution, which include: gene and genome duplication, gene reorganization, mutation (of DNA), selection, and random (non-selective) processes (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event">meteor impacts</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allopatric_speciation">formation of mountain chains</a>).</p>
<p>Different types of organisms, known as species, are defined as different by their &quot;reproductive isolation&quot; from one another. As an example: A human and an oak tree are different species because they can not produce offspring that can go on to produce their own offspring (It is probably best to avoid the temptation to prove this as false!).</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are &gt; 1,500,000 (1.5 x 10<sup>6</sup>) types of living organisms, of which about ~750,000 are insects, ~250,000 are plants, and ~41,000 are vertebrates (you are a vertebrate and &quot;&gt;&quot; means greater than and &quot;~&quot; means &quot;approximately&quot;).</p>
<p>The number of distinct microbial (i.e., bacteria and other single-celled organisms) species remains difficult to determine accurately, in part because of the ubiquity of what is known as &quot;horizontal gene transfer&quot; and the lack of sexual reproduction in such organisms. As you can see, our current definition of a species (i.e., reproductive isolation) is difficult to apply to some life-forms. Defining species can be a difficult task for biologists (but we like challenges!).</p>
<p>While there are currently millions of different types of organisms, over the course of Earth's history there have been even more. Most types of organisms that have existed no longer do, they are extinct. To be extinct means that they have no living descendants.</p>
<p>Today there are organisms that range in size from less than 0.000001 (10<sup>-6</sup>) meters (1 µm) to more than 30 meters long, a range of over 107 fold.</p>

<p>Organisms range from those consisting of a single-cell, known generically as microbes, to multicellular plants and animals, which can contain over 10<sup>14</sup> (trillions) distinct cells (like your own body).</p>
<p>A particular type of organism can live independently or in communities, and different types of organisms live together in ecosystems. For example, microbes often live together in biofilms (e.g., plaque buildup on teeth). Within a biofilm, organisms can cooperate or compete (or both) with one another in complex and evolving ways. Right now, there are many microbes living within your gut, and together with you, they form an <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21787875">&quot;enteric&quot; ecosystem&quot;</a>. Look outside to see another another ecosystem in action.</p>
<p>The simplest form of multicellular organisms are colonies of related cells, held together in loose aggregates. In these simple colonial organisms, all cells can reproduce or divide to make new organisms. A major innovation in the history of life was the appearance of “true” multicellular organisms.</p>
<p>Multicellular organisms have different types of cells that carry out different functions and only a small subset of cells, known as <strong>germ cells</strong>, found in the testes and ovaries of humans, produce the next generation of organisms. Other cells, known as <strong>somatic cells</strong>, form the body of the organism, and perform specific roles like: secretion of enzymes to digest food, production of energy (ATP; see below), movement, cognitive abilities, and (taken together) all other functions and actions of the organism. <strong>One of the most important concepts that you should understand after taking this course is that all of the actions and functions of your body are the actions and function of your cells</strong>. Understanding cells is paramount to understanding organisms.</p>

<p><strong>Common features of cells, the basic unit of life:</strong> All cells share a large number of common features, inherited from their ancestors in an unbroken tree of life that goes back ~4 billion years. In analogy with computers, all cells use a version of the same basic operating system.</p>
<p>They store genetic information in molecules of deoxyribonucleic acid (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA">DNA</a>). To use this information it must be first transferred into a molecule of ribonucleic acid (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA">RNA</a>). The DNA-dependent synthesis of RNA is known as transcription. DNA is copied (transcribed) to RNA. RNA molecules have a number of roles in cells, one of which is to direct the synthesis of proteins - this process of RNA-directed protein synthesis is known as translation. Translation is performed by a catalyst composed of RNAs and proteins, the ribosome. With each new cell formed, DNA is replicated and the &quot;daughter&quot;cell receives a copy - a copy is also retained by the mother cell.</p>
<p>DNA is not completely stable and replication is not error free; changes in the DNA (mutations) occur, although most are repaired. With minor (explicable) variations, all organisms use the same universal code that links DNA sequences to protein sequences.</p>
<p>Replication, transcription, and translation are chemical reactions that require energy to occur. The same is true for any chemical reaction. This energy is captured from the external world; from outside the cell and ultimately from outside of you (hamburgers can be a great source of energy). Cells store much of this energy for immediate use as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The hydrolysis or chemical breakdown of ATP using water to form ADP (adenosine diphosphate) + phosphate is a thermodynamically favorable reaction (occurs readily inside cells), and can be coupled to unfavorable reactions in order to drive those unfavorable reactions (occurs less readily inside cells).</p>
<p>Many of the chemical reactions used to capture energy, to build and disassemble macromolecules (e.g. proteins and nucleic acids), are common to all cells. Cells and all life share a common central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolism</a>.</p>
<p>Cells have a boundary layer, a plasma membrane, that separates their insides (called cytoplasm) from the external world. This membrane is composed of a lipid bilayer and embedded and associated proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Features of all cells</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Information is stored in DNA using a universal code (this enables us to use the fossil record and DNA sequence comparisons to map the relationships between living organisms.)</li>
<li>DNA acts as the template for RNA synthesis (transcription).</li>
<li>Many RNAs encode polypeptides (proteins); the synthesis of polypeptides (translation) is catalyzed by ribosomes.</li>
<li>Cells are surrounded by lipid-protein membranes.</li>
<li>Imported energy is used to maintain cellular structure and to build new cells.</li>
<li>Cells share many common chemical reactions (metabolism).</li>
<li>Cells store chemical energy in molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as well as in ion gradients across membranes.</li>
<li>Cells couple thermodynamically favorable reactions to drive thermodynamically unfavorable reactions (including replication, transcription, translation).</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p><strong>The Theory of Evolution:</strong></p>
<p>Because DNA is not completely stable, and because errors can occur during its replication, changes in DNA (mutations) occur and are passed on to daughter cells.</p>
<p>Mutations can have a range of effects on the organism that inherits them, from little or none to death. Over time, different organisms will have different genotypes (DNA molecules) that lead to different phenotypes (different behaviors, physical characteristics, etc).</p>
<p>Because of their phenotypic differences, some organisms reproduce more successfully than others. They are better at surviving long enough to reproduce. Which organisms reproduce most successfully will be determined in part by interactions with their environment (which includes other organisms).</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Over many generations the differential reproductive success of individuals will lead to changes in the frequency of specific genotypes within a population. This in turn will lead to changes in phenotypes, the population will evolve.</p>
<p>Over time, evolution responds to changes in a population's environment, as well as changes within the population which influence reproductive success.</p>
<p>A population that fails to adapt rapidly enough to changes in its environment may disappear, it will become extinct.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/Various_dinosaurs.png" alt="Figure: Dinosaurs are extinct reptiles." /><figcaption><em>Figure: Dinosaurs are extinct reptiles.</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Populations can also divide and adapt to different environments, a process that overtime leads to reproductive isolation between populations, this produces new types of species of organisms.</p>
