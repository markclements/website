    <h2 id="m44749">The Central Nervous System</h2>
    <p>The <em>central nervous system (CNS)</em> is made up of the
      brain and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of
      protective coverings called <em>meninges</em> (“meninges” is
      derived from the Greek and means “membranes”) (<a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Desktop/Concepts%20of%20Biology/content/ch16.html#m45539-fig-ch16_06_03"
        title="Figure&nbsp;16.21.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;16.21</a>). The
      outermost layer is the dura mater, the middle layer is the
      web-like arachnoid mater, and the inner layer is the pia mater,
      which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord. The
      space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with <em>cerebrospinal


        fluid (CSF)</em>. The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a
      cushion and shock absorber.</p>

        brain. The outermost layer, just beneath the skull, is the dura
        mater. The dura mater is the thickest meninge, and blood vessels
        run through it. Beneath the dura mater is the arachnoid mater,
        and beneath this is the pia mater." width="300" height="239"></p>

    <h3 id="m44749-fs-idm230663440">Brain</h3>
    <p>The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is
      contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It includes the
      cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus,
      hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and retinas. The outermost
      part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called
      the <em>cerebral cortex</em>. The cerebral cortex, limbic system,
      and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A thick
      fiber bundle called the <em>corpus callosum</em> (corpus =
      “body”; callosum = “tough”) connects the two hemispheres. Although
      there are some brain functions that are localized more to one
      hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres
      are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire
      hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do
      suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have
      surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is
      performed on children who have very immature nervous systems.</p>
    <p>In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum
      is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a
      condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique
      functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an object is
      presented to patients’ left visual field, they may be unable to
      verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object
      at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual
      field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then
      signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left
      side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked
      to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the
      left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be
      unable to verbally identify it.</p>

        alt="Illustration shows coronal (front) and sagittal (side)
        sections of a human brain. In the coronal section, the large
        upper part of the brain, called the cerebral cortex, is divided
        into left and right hemispheres. A cavity resembling butterfly
        wings exists between the left and right cortex. The corpus
        callosum is a band that connects the two hemispheres together,
        just above this cavity. The surface of the cerebral cortex
        contains bumpy protrusions called gyri. The cerebral cortex is
        anchored by the brain stem, which connects with the spinal cord.
        On either side of the brainstem tucked beneath the cerebral
        cortex is the cerebellum. The surface of the cerebellum is
        bumpy, but not as bumpy as the cerebral cortex. The sagittal
        section reveals that the cerebral cortex makes up the front and
        top part of the brain, while the brainstem and cerebellum make
        up the lower back part. The oval thalamus sits in the cavity in
        the middle of the cerebral cortex. The corpus callosum wraps
        around the top part thalamus. The basal ganglia wraps around the
        corpus callosum, starting at the lower front part of the brain
        and continuing three-quarters of the way around so the back end
        almost meets the front end. The basal ganglia is separated into
        segments that are connected along the top and bottom. The

    <p>Each hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved

        brain, and the temporal lobe is at the bottom center of the
        brain. The motor cortex is the back of the frontal lobe, and the
        olfactory bulb is the bottom part. The somatosensory cortex is
        the front part of the parietal lobe. The brainstem is beneath
        the temporal lobe, and the cerebellum is beneath the occipital
        lobe."></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.21.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal,
      temporal, and occipital lobes.</p>
    <p>The <em>frontal lobe</em> is located at the front of the brain,
      over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which
      processes smells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex,
      which is important for planning and implementing movement. Areas
      within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups. Neurons in
      the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining
      attention, speech, and decision-making. Studies of humans who have
      damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are
      involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk.</p>

        alt="Diagram shows the location of motor control for various
        muscle groups on the right hemisphere cerebral cortex. From the
        top middle of the motor cortex to the bottom right, the order of
        areas controlled is toes, ankles, knees, hips, trunk, shoulders,
        elbows, wrists, hands, fingers, thumbs, neck, eyebrows and
        eyelids, eyeballs, face, lips, jaw, tongue, salivation, chewing
        and swallowing."></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.22.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle
      groups. Muscle groups that are neighbors in the body are generally
      controlled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well. For
      example, the neurons that control finger movement are near the
      neurons that control hand movement.</p>
    <p>The <em>parietal lobe</em> is located at the top of the brain.
      Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also
      reading. Two of the parietal lobe’s main functions are processing
      somatosensation—touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat,
      cold—and processing proprioception—the sense of how parts of the
      body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains a
      somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex. The <em>occipital


        lobe</em> is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily
      involved in vision—seeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual
      world. The <em>temporal lobe</em> is located at the base of the
      brain and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting
      sounds. It also contains the <em>hippocampus</em> (named from the
      Greek for “seahorse,” which it resembles in shape) a structure
      that processes memory formation. The role of the hippocampus in
      memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic
      patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an
      attempt to cure his epilepsy. His seizures went away, but he could
      no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts
      from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks).</p>
    <p>Interconnected brain areas called the <em>basal ganglia</em>
      play important roles in movement control and posture. The basal
      ganglia also regulate motivation.</p>
    <p>The <em>thalamus</em> acts as a gateway to and from the cortex.
      It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also
      receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can
      modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending
      on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus
      helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states.</p>

        and hypothalamus are located in the cavity in the center of the
        cerebral cortex. The cingulate gyrus is part of the cerebral
        cortex that wraps around the upper part of the basal ganglia.
        The hippocampus is part of the cerebral cortex located beneath
        the thalamus. The amygdala is located at the end of the basal
        ganglia." width="400" height="265"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.24.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The limbic system regulates emotion and other behaviors. It
      includes parts of the cerebral cortex located near the center of
      the brain, including the cingulate gyrus and the hippocampus as
      well as the thalamus, hypothalamus and amygdala.</p>
    <p>Below the thalamus is the <em>hypothalamus</em>. The
      hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to
      the pituitary gland. Among other functions, the hypothalamus is
      the body’s thermostat—it makes sure the body temperature is kept
      at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also
      regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.</p>
    <p>The <em>limbic system</em> is a connected set of structures that
      regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and
      motivation. It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts
      of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One
      important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe
      structure called the <em>amygdala</em>. The two amygdala (one on
      each side) are important both for the sensation of fear and for
      recognizing fearful faces.</p>
    <p>The <em>cerebellum</em> (cerebellum = “little brain”) sits at
      the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The cerebellum
      controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning
      new motor tasks. The cerebellum of birds is large compared to
      other vertebrates because of the coordination required by flight.</p>
    <p>The <em>brainstem</em> connects the rest of the brain with the
      spinal cord and regulates some of the most important and basic
      functions of the nervous system including breathing, swallowing,
      digestion, sleeping, walking, and sensory and motor information
      integration.</p>
    <h3 id="m44749-fs-idm87091520">Spinal Cord</h3>
    <p>Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through
      the spinal column is the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a thick
      bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to
      the brain and from the brain to the body. The spinal cord is
      contained within the meninges and the bones of the vertebral
      column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body
      through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral
      nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a
      white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape (Figure 35.25). Axons
      make up the “white matter” and neuron and glia cell bodies (and
      interneurons) make up the “gray matter.” Axons and cell bodies in
      the dorsa spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the
      body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the spinal cord
      primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to
      the body.</p>
    <p>The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are
      quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a hand
      from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local
      synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a doctor
      tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse
      between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a reflex may
      only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with
      interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the
      brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was
      hot).</p>

        oval white matter. The legs of the X are thicker than the arms.

      cell bodies and interneurons) and white matter (containing axons).</p>
    <h2 id="m44751">The Peripheral Nervous System</h2>
    <p>The <em>peripheral nervous system (PNS)</em> is the connection
      between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. The
      PNS can be broken down into the <em>autonomic nervous system</em>,
      which controls bodily functions without conscious control, and the
      <em>sensory-somatic nervous system</em>, which transmits sensory
      information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to the CNS
      and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.</p>
    <h3 id="m44751-fs-idp90728576">Autonomic Nervous System</h3>

src="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Documents/markclements/website/HumanBio/m44751/Figure_35_04_01f.png"
        alt="The autonomic nervous system is divided into sympathetic
        and parasympathetic systems. In the sympathetic system, the soma
        of the preganglionic neurons is usually located in the spine
        while in the parasympathetic system the soma is usually in the
        brainstem or sacral, at the bottom of the spine. In both
        systems, the preganglionic neuron releases the neurotransmitter
        acetylcholine into the synapse. Postganglionic neurons of the
        sympathetic system have somas in a sympathetic ganglion, located
        next to the spinal cord. Postganglionic neurons of the
        parasympathetic system have somas in ganglions near the target
        organ. Postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system release
        norepinephrine into the synapse, while postganglionic neurons of
        the parasympathetic system release acetylcholine or nitric
        oxide." width="500" height="664"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.26.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the autonomic nervous system, a preganglionic neuron of the
      CNS synapses with a postganglionic neuron of the PNS. The
      postganglionic neuron, in turn, acts on a target organ. Autonomic
      responses are mediated by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
      systems, which are antagonistic to one another. The sympathetic
      system activates the “fight or flight” response, while the
      parasympathetic system activates the “rest and digest” response.</p>
    <p>Which of the following statements is false?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The parasympathetic pathway is responsible for resting the
          body, while the sympathetic pathway is responsible for
          preparing for an emergency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic pathway
          originate in the spinal cord.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Slowing of the heartbeat is a parasympathetic response.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Parasympathetic neurons are responsible for releasing
          norepinephrine on the target organ, while sympathetic neurons
          are responsible for releasing acetylcholine.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS
      and the internal organs. It controls the lungs, the heart, smooth
      muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous
      system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it
      can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems
      and implement changes as needed. Signaling to the target tissue
      usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating
      in the CNS) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn,
      synapses on the target organ (Figure 35.27). There are two
      divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing
      effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic
      nervous system.</p>
    <p>The <em>sympathetic nervous system</em> is responsible for the
      immediate responses an animal makes when it encounters a dangerous
      situation. One way to remember this is to think of the
      “fight-or-flight” response a person feels when encountering a
      snake (“snake” and “sympathetic” both begin with “s”). Examples of
      functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an
      accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions
      help prepare an organism’s body for the physical strain required
      to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a
      predator.</p>

        slows the heart rate, and stimulates salivation, digestion, and
        bile secretion. Preganglionic neurons that mediate these effects
        are all located in the brain stem. Preganglionic neurons of the
        parasympathetic system that are located in the sacral cause the
        bladder to contract. The sympathetic system causes pupils and
        bronchi to dilate, increases heart rate, inhibits digestion,
        stimulates the breakdown of glycogen and the secretion of
        adrenaline and noradrenaline, and inhibits contraction of the
        bladder. The preganglionic neurons that mediate these effects
        are all located in the spine." width="500" height="484"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.27.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have
      opposing effects on target organs.</p>
    <p>While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful
      situations, the <em>parasympathetic nervous system</em> allows an
      animal to “rest and digest.” One way to remember this is to think
      that during a restful situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic
      nervous system is in control (“picnic” and “parasympathetic” both
      start with “p”). Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell
      bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the
      bottom) spinal cord (<a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Desktop/Concepts%20of%20Biology/content/ch16.html#m45539-fig-ch16_06_07"
        title="Figure&nbsp;16.25.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;16.25</a>). The
      parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the
      sympathetic nervous system is activated including slowing of heart
      rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.</p>
    <p>The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and
      spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons. Sensory
      neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal
      muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons transmit
      messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to
      make them contract. Without its sensory-somatic nervous system, an
      animal would be unable to process any information about its
      environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not
      control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system,
      which usually has two synapses between the CNS and the target
      organ, sensory and motor neurons usually have only one synapse—one
      ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly
      contacts a CNS neuron.</p>
    <p><strong>Questions to answer:</strong><br>
    </p>

      particular brain region?<br>
    </p>
    2. What are the main functions of the spinal cord?<br>

    <br>
    5. Why do you think surgeries to treat brain and nervous system
