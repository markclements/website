<h2 id="storing-energy-in-molecules-and-gradients">Storing energy in molecules and gradients</h2>
<hr />
<p>There are a number of ways that cells store energy. The synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is the most familiar.</p>
<p>As you (hopefully) appreciate, whenever a bond is formed, energy is released - it always takes energy to break a bond</p>
<p>Generally, the energy required to break bonds comes from the kinetic energy of surrounding molecules (similarly the energy released upon bond formation is often transformed into kinetic energy).</p>

<p>When we think about a molecule like ATP and energy, we have to consider all of the bonds that are broken and formed in the process.</p>
<p>ATP is typically formed from ADP and Pi. We have to break a number of rather stable bonds in both ADP and Pi to form the new and rather unstable ADP- Pi bond in ATP. [what makes ATP unstable?]</p>
<p>Another class of “high energy/low stability” molecules involves the reduction of certain compounds. For example, the addition of two electrons and a proton to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) leads to the formation of the high energy/unstable molecule NADH.</p>
<p><img src="./img/NAD.jpg" alt="Figure: NAD is a low energy molecule" />] <img src="./img/NADH.jpg" alt="Figure: NADH is a high energy molecule" />]</p>
<p>Similarly, the addition of two electrons and two protons to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) leads to the formation of FADH<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Both NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are high energy/unstable compounds, like ATP. When electrons are removed from NAPH or FADH<sub>2</sub>, that is when these molecules are oxidized, this energy is released, and NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD are regenerated.</p>
<p>The energy carried by NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> is used to drive a number of cellular reactions, it can also be used to generate ATP.</p>
<hr />
<p>How does the cell use the energy stored in NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to make ATP? The answer came from the work of an eccentric British scientist, <a href="http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/%7Emsaier/transport/petermitchell/one.html">Peter Mitchell</a> It is known as the chemiosmotic hypothesis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nobel.se/chemistry/laureates/1978/mitchell-bio.html"><img src="./img/mitchell.jpg" alt="Figure: Peter Mitchell" /></a></p>

<p>Mitchell proposed that the energy held in NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> was used to generate a concentration gradient of H<sup>+</sup> across the plasma membrane in bacterial cells.</p>
<p>Electrons, removed from NADH or FADH<sub>2</sub>, pass through an electron transport chain.</p>
<p>The electron transport chain is a set of membrane proteins that interact with one another in pairs of redox reactions.</p>
<p>As high energy electrons move from one component of the electron transport chain to the next, the first is oxidized, the second is reduced, some energy is &quot;bled-off’ and used to pump H<sup>+</sup>s out of the cell, forming an H<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient across the membrane.</p>

<p><strong>ATP synthases</strong> consist of two parts, the F<sub>o</sub> membrane channel and the F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase. The ATP synthase mediates a series of coupled reactions. The first is the movement of H<sup>+</sup>s down their concentration gradient (through the ATP synthase).</p>
<p>The ATP synthase couples this thermodynamically favorable reaction with a second reaction, the ADP + Pi ↔ ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O reaction, which is thermodynamically unfavorable.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there is nothing about this reaction that stops it (under the right conditions) from running backward. When this occurs, the ATP synthase acts as an ATPase and a pump that can move H<sup>+</sup>s against its concentration gradient.</p>

<p><em>Movie: Watch synthase in action!</em></p>
<p>As H+s move through the ATP synthase, the molecule rotates, this rotation “forces” ADP + Pi together to form ATP.</p>

<p>This (above) is a higher magnification view of the process, where you can see ADP and Pi binding, ATP formation, and then release.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Back to electrons:</strong> So where do the electrons end up? They have to go somewhere!</p>
<p>O<sub>2</sub> is a very efficient oxidizer, that is, an acceptor of electrons from other molecules. In the presence of O<sub>2</sub> and an electron transport chain, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are oxidized to form NAD<sup>+</sup> and FADH (they are recycled).</p>
<p>The electrons pass through the electron transport chain, as they move H<sup>+</sup>s are moved across the membrane to form a H<sup>+</sup> gradient.</p>

</figure>
<p>Eventually four of these electrons (and four H<sup>+</sup>s) are added to two O<sub>2</sub>s, creating two water molecules. Again this is a thermodynamically favorable reaction.</p>
<p>Under aerobic conditions (that is in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>), glucose can be broken down completely to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O; much (~60%) of the energy originally present in the glucose molecule is captured as ATP (what happens to the rest?)</p>
<p>In the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, that is under anaerobic conditions, the breakdown of pyruvate to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O cannot occur - the energy in pyruvate is unavailable to the cell.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/anaerobic.gif" alt="Figure: Anaerobic respiration" /><figcaption><em>Figure: Anaerobic respiration</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cell contains limited amounts of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH (can you imagine why?)</p>
<p>In order for a cell to continue to metabolize glucose, it must regenerate its NAD<sup>+</sup>. In the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, the regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> involves the oxidation of NADH by pyruvate.</p>
<p>Most of the energy present in the glucose molecule is still present in products of this reaction; only about 6% of the energy present in glucose is captured in the absence of molecular oxygen.</p>
