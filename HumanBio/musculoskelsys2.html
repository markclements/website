    <h3>ATP and Muscle Contraction </h3>
    <p>The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to
      actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires energy,
      which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site
      on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site for
      ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and
      inorganic phosphate (which are more stable) releasing energy.</p>
    <p>ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and
      myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly
      bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P<sub>i</sub>.
      The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The
      energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the
      myosin head into a “cocked” (high energy) position. The myosin
      head is then in a position for further movement, possessing
      potential energy, but ADP and P<sub>i</sub> are still attached. If
      actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will
      remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but
      still attached.</p>
    <p>If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will
      form; that is, the myosin head attaches to the actin molecules. P<sub>i</sub>
      is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a
      conformational change. The myosin head moves toward the M line,
      pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the
      filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This
      movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which
      force is produced. As the actin is pulled toward the M line, the
      sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.</p>
    <p>When the myosin head is “cocked,” it contains energy and is in a
      high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the myosin
      head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power
      stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. After the
      power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is
      still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. ATP can
      then attach to myosin, myosin detaches from actin, which allows
      the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle
      contraction can occur (<a href="ch38.html#m44788-fig-ch38_04_05"

        and Pi attached sticks up from the myosin filament. The

        filament, allowing the myosin head to from a cross-bridge.
        During the power stroke, the myosin head bends and ADP and
        phosphate are released. As a result, the actin filament moves
        relative to the myosin filament. A new molecule of ATP binds to

        and Pi, returning the myosin head to the cocked position."

    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idp31333072">Regulatory Proteins</h3>
    <p>When a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are
      separated. To keep actin from binding to the active site on
      myosin, regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites. <em>Tropomyosin</em>
      blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing
      cross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle
      without nervous input. <em>Troponin</em> binds to tropomyosin and
      helps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium
      ions.</p>
    <p>To enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change
      conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin
      molecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. This can only happen
      in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low
      concentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to
      troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that allow
      tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin.
      Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can form between
      actin and myosin, triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling
      continues until Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and ATP are no longer
      available and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.</p>
    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm29815056">Excitation–Contraction Coupling</h3>
    <p>Like neuronal cells, muscle cells generate and transmit
      electrical signals. The details of how muscle cells generate and
      transmit action potentials and establish and maintain a resting
      membrane potentials (-70 mv) can (and should) be reviewed in the
      nervous system chapter. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Excitation–contraction coupling is the link (transduction)
      between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the
      start of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release
      from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural
      signal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor
      neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to
      the muscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that
      interacts with the neuron is called the <em>motor end plate</em>.
      The end of the neuron’s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and
      it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space
      called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the
      motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the neuron’s
      axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual
      muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.</p>
    <p>Communication occurs between nerves and muscles through
      neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of
      neurotransmitters from the synaptic terminal into the synaptic
      cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and
      bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate. The motor end
      plate possesses junctional folds—folds in the sarcolemma that
      create a large surface area for the neurotransmitter to bind to
      receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to
      allow the passage of Na<sup>+</sup> into the cell when they
      receive neurotransmitter signal.</p>
    <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor
      neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate. Once
      released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the
      synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds with ACh
      receptors. As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open,
      and Na<sup>+</sup> ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell.
      This reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside
      of the cell (depolarization). As ACh binds at the motor end plate,
      this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The
      depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma, creating an
      action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial
      depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open. The
      action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of
      depolarization.</p>
    <p>ACh is broken down by the enzyme <em>acetylcholinesterase</em>
      (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides in the synaptic
      cleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh
      receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction

    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_06f.png" alt="There are four steps
        in the start of a muscle contraction. Step 1: Acetylcholine
        released from synaptic vesicles in the axon terminal binds to
        receptors on the muscle cell plasma membrane. Step 2: An action
        potential is initiated that travels down the T tubule. Step 3:
        Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in
        response to the change in voltage. Step 4: Calcium ions bind to
        troponin, exposing active sites on actin. Cross-bridge formation
        occurs and muscles contract. Three additional steps are part of
        the end of a muscle contraction. Step 5: Acetylcholine is
        removed from the synaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase. Step 6:
        Calcium ions are transported back into the sarcoplasmic
        reticulum. Step 7: Tropomyosin covers active sites on actin
        preventing cross-bridge formation, so the muscle contraction
        ends." width="550" height="601"></p>

    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm104729504">Control of Muscle Tension</h3>
    <p>Neural control initiates the formation of actin–myosin
      cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in
      muscle contraction. These contractions extend from the muscle
      fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal
      movement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the
      amount of force created by this tension can vary. This enables the
      same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In
      individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced depends
      on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency
      of neural stimulation.</p>
    <p>The number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin
      determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can produce.
      Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments
      overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-bridges
      are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will
      be produced.</p>
    <p>The ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal
      tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the
      greatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal
      resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the
      greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in
      fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is produced.
      As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the
      thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed of myosin
      tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin
      will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the tension
      produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even
      more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each other—reducing
      cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less
      tension. Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched to the point at
      which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no
      cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. This amount
      of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins,
      internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme
      stretching.</p>
    <p>The primary variable determining force production is the number
      of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action potential
      from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to
      pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only signals a few
      neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In
      vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if stimulated. When
      picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in
      the biceps and every myofiber participates. This is close to the
      maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above,
      increasing the frequency of action potentials (the number of
      signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the
      tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.</p>
