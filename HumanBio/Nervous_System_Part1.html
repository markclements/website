    <p>An athlete’s nervous system is hard at work during the planning
      and execution of a movement as precise as a high jump. Parts of
      the nervous system are involved in determining how hard to push
      off and when to turn, as well as controlling the muscles
      throughout the body that make this complicated movement possible
      without knocking the bar down—all in just a few seconds. (credit:

    <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>When you’re reading this book, your nervous system is performing
      several functions simultaneously. The visual system is processing
      what is seen on the page; the motor system controls the turn of
      the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains
      attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and
      regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous
      system. A nervous system is an organism’s control center: it
      processes sensory information from outside (and inside) the body
      and controls all behaviors—from eating to sleeping to finding a
      mate.</p>
    <h2 id="m44747">Neurons and Glial Cells</h2>
    <p>Vertebrate nervous systems are complex, centralized, and
      specialized compared to other animal nervous systems (e.g.,
      insects and other invertebrates) . While there is great diversity
      among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic
      structure: a central nervous system (CNS) that contains a brain
      and spinal cord and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) made up of
      peripheral sensory and motor nerves. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The nervous system is made up of <em>neurons</em>, specialized
      cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical
      signals, and <em>glia</em>, cells that provide support functions
      for the neurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire—it
      transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared
      to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to
      the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that are
      broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent
      evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling functions
      of neurons.</p>
    <p>There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that
      are present in different parts of the nervous system. All types of
      neurons share several important cellular components.</p>
    <h3 id="m44747-fs-idp237666720">Neurons</h3>
    <p>The nervous system of the common laboratory fly, <em>Drosophila
        melanogaster</em>, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same
      number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the
      mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains
      around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers,
      the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same
      behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like
      finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to
      communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells
      underlies all of these behaviors.</p>
    <p>Most neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are
      also highly specialized—different types of neurons have different
      sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.</p>
    <h4 id="m44747-fs-idp256040352">Parts of a Neuron</h4>
    <p>Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that
      contains a nucleus, mitochondria, and other cellular components
      (e.g., smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus).
      Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in <a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Documents/markclements/website/HumanBio/ch35.html#m44747-fig-ch35_01_02"
        title="Figure&nbsp;35.3.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;35.3</a> for
      receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal
      communication possible. <em>Dendrites</em> are tree-like
      structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages
      from other neurons at specialized junctions called <em>synapses</em>.
      Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of
      neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small
      protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase
      surface area for possible synaptic connections.</p>
    <p>Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels
      passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized
      structure, the <em>axon hillock</em> that integrates signals from
      multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body
      and an <em>axon</em>. An axon is a tube-like structure that
      propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called <em>axon



        terminals</em>. These terminals in turn synapse on other
      neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon
      terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells.
      Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like
      amacrine cells in the retina, do not contain any axons. Some axons
      are covered with <em>myelin</em>, which acts as an insulator to
      minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down
      the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This
      insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can
      be as long as a meter—from the base of the spine to the toes. The
      myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is
      produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in
      the myelin sheath. These gaps are called <em>nodes of Ranvier</em>
      and are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along
      the axon.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that a single neuron does not act
      alone—neuronal communication depends on the connections that
      neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like
      muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic
      contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a
      Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact
      from as many as 200,000 other neurons.</p>

        alt="Illustration shows a neuron. The main part of the cell
        body, called the soma, contains the nucleus. Branch-like
        dendrites project from three sides of the soma. A long, thin
        axon projects from the fourth side. The axon branches at the
        end. The tip of the axon is in close proximity to dendrites of
        an adjacent nerve cell. The narrow space between the axon and
        dendrites is called the synapse. Cells called oligodendrocytes
        are located next to the axon. Projections from the
        oligodendrocytes wrap around the axon, forming a myelin sheath.
        The myelin sheath is not continuous, and gaps where the axon is
        exposed are called nodes of Ranvier." width="600" height="403"></p>

    <p>Neurons contain organelles common to many other cells, such as a
      nucleus and mitochondria. They also have more specialized
      structures, including dendrites and axons.</p>
    <p>Which of the following statements is false?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The soma is the cell body of a nerve cell.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Myelin sheath provides an insulating layer to the dendrites.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Axons carry the signal from the soma to the target.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dendrites carry the signal to the soma.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Glia</strong></p>
    <p>While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the
      nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually
      outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would
      be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled
      by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their
      destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm
      neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have
      recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to
      nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells.
      When glia do not function properly, the result can be
      disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Questions to answer:</strong><br>
    </p>
    <p>1. How are neurons similar to other cells? How are they unique?<br>
      2. Why are glial cells needed for proper function of the neurons
      and the nervous system? <br>
    </p>
    <h2>How Neurons Communicate</h2>
    <p>Functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor
      reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory or a
      decision—require neurons to communicate with one another. While
      humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use
      electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a
      committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages
      from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send
      the message on to other neurons.</p>
    <h3 id="m44748-fs-idm306684336">Nerve Impulse Transmission within a
      Neuron</h3>
    <p>For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send
      and receive signals. These signals are possible because each
      neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference
      between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this
      membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules
      released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To
      understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the
      basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge.</p>
    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm92021888">Neuronal Charged Membranes</h4>
    <p>The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable
      to charged molecules or ions (Can you explain why?). To enter or
      exit the neuron, ions must pass through protein ion channels. Ion
      channels can have different configurations: open, closed, and
      inactive (Figure&nbsp;35.9). Some ion channels need to be
      activated in order to allow ions to pass through the membrane. Ion
      channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their
      shape (open or close) accordingly. Voltage-gated ion channels
      change their structure in response to voltage changes. These
      channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions
      inside and outside the cell and differences in concentrations
      establish a charge difference called the <em>membrane potential</em>.</p>

        After the impulse the channel enters an inactive state. The
        channel closes by a different mechanism and, for a brief period
        does not reopen in response to a new nerve impulse." width="600"

    <p>This <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/resting_neuron">video</a>
      discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Resting Membrane Potential </h3>
    <p>A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is
      approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (−70
      mV, note that this number varies by neuron type and by animal
      species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential;
      it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside
      and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to
      all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the
      system would reach equilibrium (can you explain why?). Because
      ions and other charged molecules cannot simply cross the membrane
      at will&nbsp; there are different concentrations of several
      charged molecules and ions inside and outside the cell (can you
      explain why?).</p>
    <p>The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the
      resting potential. The sodium potassium pumps brings two K<sup>+</sup>
      ions into the cell while removing three Na<sup>+</sup> ions per
      ATP consumed. When the membrane is at rest, K<sup>+</sup> ions
      accumulate inside the cell and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulate outside.
      The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell
      membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than
      sodium ion movement. The cell possesses potassium and sodium
      channels that allow the two cations to slowly leak (slowly
      diffuse) down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons
      have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage
      channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much
      faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations (+ charged
      ions) are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the
      interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the
      outside of the cell due to the fact that negatively charged
      proteins and phosphates (also negatively charged) in the cytoplasm
      are unable to leave the cell. As more cations are expelled from
      the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell becomes
      increasingly negatively charged relative to the extracellular
      fluid. It should be noted that calcium ions (Cl<sup>–</sup>) tend
      to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by
      negatively-charged proteins and phosphates within the cytoplasm
      (Figure 35.10a)<br>

        alt="The resting membrane potential of minus seventy volts is
        maintained by a sodium/potassium transporter that transports
        sodium ions out of the cell and potassium ions in. Voltage gated
        sodium and potassium channels are closed. In response to a nerve
        impulse, some sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions to
        enter the cell. The membrane starts to depolarize; in other
        words, the charge across the membrane lessens. If the membrane
        potential increases to the threshold of excitation, all the
        sodium channels open. At the peak action potential, potassium
        channels open and potassium ions leave the cell. The membrane
        eventually becomes hyperpolarized." width="600" height="850"></p>
