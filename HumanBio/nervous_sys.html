    <p>An athlete’s nervous system is hard at work during the planning
      and execution of a movement as precise as a high jump. Parts of
      the nervous system are involved in determining how hard to push
      off and when to turn, as well as controlling the muscles
      throughout the body that make this complicated movement possible
      without knocking the bar down—all in just a few seconds. (credit:

    <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>When you’re reading this book, your nervous system is performing
      several functions simultaneously. The visual system is processing
      what is seen on the page; the motor system controls the turn of
      the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains
      attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and
      regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous
      system. A nervous system is an organism’s control center: it
      processes sensory information from outside (and inside) the body
      and controls all behaviors—from eating to sleeping to finding a
      mate.</p>
    <h2 id="m44747">Neurons and Glial Cells</h2>
    <p>Vertebrate nervous systems are complex, centralized, and
      specialized compared to other animal nervous systems (e.g.,
      insects and other invertebrates) . While there is great diversity
      among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic
      structure: a central nervous system (CNS) that contains a brain
      and spinal cord and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) made up of
      peripheral sensory and motor nerves. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The nervous system is made up of <em>neurons</em>, specialized
      cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical
      signals, and <em>glia</em>, cells that provide support functions
      for the neurons. A neuron can be compared to an electrical wire—it
      transmits a signal from one place to another. Glia can be compared
      to the workers at the electric company who make sure wires go to
      the right places, maintain the wires, and take down wires that are
      broken. Although glia have been compared to workers, recent
      evidence suggests that also usurp some of the signaling functions
      of neurons.</p>
    <p>There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that
      are present in different parts of the nervous system. All types of
      neurons share several important cellular components.</p>
    <h3 id="m44747-fs-idp237666720">Neurons</h3>
    <p>The nervous system of the common laboratory fly, <em>Drosophila
        melanogaster</em>, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same
      number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the
      mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains
      around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers,
      the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same
      behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like
      finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to
      communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells
      underlies all of these behaviors.</p>
    <p>Most neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are
      also highly specialized—different types of neurons have different
      sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.</p>
    <h4 id="m44747-fs-idp256040352">Parts of a Neuron</h4>
    <p>Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that
      contains a nucleus, mitochondria, and other cellular components
      (e.g., smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus).
      Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in <a
        href="ch35.html#m44747-fig-ch35_01_02"
        title="Figure&nbsp;35.3.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;35.3</a> for
      receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal
      communication possible. <em>Dendrites</em> are tree-like
      structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages
      from other neurons at specialized junctions called <em>synapses</em>.
      Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of
      neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small
      protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase
      surface area for possible synaptic connections.</p>
    <p>Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels
      passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized
      structure, the <em>axon hillock</em> that integrates signals from
      multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body
      and an <em>axon</em>. An axon is a tube-like structure that
      propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called <em>axon


        terminals</em>. These terminals in turn synapse on other
      neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon
      terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells.
      Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like
      amacrine cells in the retina, do not contain any axons. Some axons
      are covered with <em>myelin</em>, which acts as an insulator to
      minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down
      the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This
      insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can
      be as long as a meter—from the base of the spine to the toes. The
      myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is
      produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in
      the myelin sheath. These gaps are called <em>nodes of Ranvier</em>
      and are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along
      the axon.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that a single neuron does not act
      alone—neuronal communication depends on the connections that
      neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like
      muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic
      contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a
      Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact
      from as many as 200,000 other neurons.</p>

    <p><img src="m44747/Figure_35_01_02.png" alt="Illustration shows a
        neuron. The main part of the cell body, called the soma,
        contains the nucleus. Branch-like dendrites project from three
        sides of the soma. A long, thin axon projects from the fourth
        side. The axon branches at the end. The tip of the axon is in
        close proximity to dendrites of an adjacent nerve cell. The
        narrow space between the axon and dendrites is called the
        synapse. Cells called oligodendrocytes are located next to the
        axon. Projections from the oligodendrocytes wrap around the
        axon, forming a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is not
        continuous, and gaps where the axon is exposed are called nodes
        of Ranvier." width="600" height="403"></p>

    <p>Neurons contain organelles common to many other cells, such as a
      nucleus and mitochondria. They also have more specialized
      structures, including dendrites and axons.</p>
    <p>Which of the following statements is false?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The soma is the cell body of a nerve cell.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Myelin sheath provides an insulating layer to the dendrites.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Axons carry the signal from the soma to the target.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Dendrites carry the signal to the soma.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Glia</strong></p>
    <p>While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the
      nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually
      outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would
      be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled
      by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their
      destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm
      neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have
      recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to
      nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells.
      When glia do not function properly, the result can be
      disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.<br>
    </p>
    <p><strong>Questions to answer:</strong><br>
    </p>
    <p>1. How are neurons similar to other cells? How are they unique?<br>
      2. Why are glial cells needed for proper function of the neurons
      and the nervous system? <br>
    </p>
    <h2>How Neurons Communicate</h2>
    <p>Functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor
      reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory or a
      decision—require neurons to communicate with one another. While
      humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use
      electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a
      committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages
      from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send
      the message on to other neurons.</p>
    <h3 id="m44748-fs-idm306684336">Nerve Impulse Transmission within a
      Neuron</h3>
    <p>For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send
      and receive signals. These signals are possible because each
      neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference
      between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this
      membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules
      released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To
      understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the
      basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge.</p>
    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm92021888">Neuronal Charged Membranes</h4>
    <p>The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable
      to charged molecules or ions (Can you explain why?). To enter or
      exit the neuron, ions must pass through protein ion channels. Ion
      channels can have different configurations: open, closed, and
      inactive (Figure&nbsp;35.9). Some ion channels need to be
      activated in order to allow ions to pass through the membrane. Ion
      channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their
      shape (open or close) accordingly. Voltage-gated ion channels
      change their structure in response to voltage changes. These
      channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions
      inside and outside the cell and differences in concentrations
      establish a charge difference called the <em>membrane potential</em>.</p>
    <p><img src="m44748/Figure_35_02_01.jpg" alt="The first image shows
        a voltage-gated sodium channel that is closed at the resting
        potential. In response to a nerve impulse the channel opens,
        allowing sodium to enter the cell. After the impulse the channel
        enters an inactive state. The channel closes by a different
        mechanism and, for a brief period does not reopen in response to
        a new nerve impulse." width="600" height="243"></p>

    <p>Voltage-gated ion channels open in response to changes in

      brief period and will no longer open in response to a signal.<br>

    </p>
    <p>1. What is the difference between open,closed, and inactive ion
      channels? <br>
      2. What determines the state of the ion channels in charged

    <p>This <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/resting_neuron">video</a>
      discusses the basis of the resting membrane potential.<br>
    </p>
    <h3>Resting Membrane Potential </h3>
    <p>A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is
      approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (−70
      mV, note that this number varies by neuron type and by animal
      species). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential;
      it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside
      and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to
      all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the
      system would reach equilibrium (can you explain why?). Because
      ions and other charged molecules cannot simply cross the membrane
      at will&nbsp; there are different concentrations of several
      charged molecules and ions inside and outside the cell (can you
      explain why?).</p>
    <p>The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the
      resting potential. The sodium potassium pumps brings two K<sup>+</sup>
      ions into the cell while removing three Na<sup>+</sup> ions per
      ATP consumed. When the membrane is at rest, K<sup>+</sup> ions
      accumulate inside the cell and Na<sup>+</sup> accumulate outside.
      The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell
      membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than
      sodium ion movement. The cell possesses potassium and sodium
      channels that allow the two cations to slowly leak (slowly
      diffuse) down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons
      have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage
      channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much
      faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations (+ charged
      ions) are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the
      interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the
      outside of the cell due to the fact that negatively charged
      proteins and phosphates (also negatively charged) in the cytoplasm
      are unable to leave the cell. As more cations are expelled from
      the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell becomes
      increasingly negatively charged relative to the extracellular
      fluid. It should be noted that calcium ions (Cl<sup>–</sup>) tend
      to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by
      negatively-charged proteins and phosphates within the cytoplasm
      (Figure 35.10a)<br>

        some sodium channels open, allowing sodium ions to enter the

        charge across the membrane lessens. If the membrane potential
        increases to the threshold of excitation, all the sodium

    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm71940272">Action Potential</h4>
    <p>A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input
      is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.
      Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a
      chemical called a neurotransmitter (more later). Transmission of a
      signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried
      by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an <em>action


        potential</em>. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to
      receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, ion channels open. This
      opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in <em>depolarization</em>
      of the membrane—a decrease in the difference in voltage between
      the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory
      cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its
      threshold potential (-55 mV). Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the axon
      hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell
      (Figure&nbsp;35.10 and Figure&nbsp;35.11). Once the sodium
      channels are completely open, the neuron completely depolarizes to
      a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are
      considered an “all-or nothing” event, in that, once the threshold
      potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes.
      Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now “reset” its
      membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish
      this, the Na<sup>+</sup> channels close and cannot be opened. This
      begins the neuron’s <em>refractory period</em>, in which it
      cannot produce another action potential because its sodium
      channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup>
      channels open, allowing K<sup>+</sup> to leave the cell. As K<sup>+</sup>
      ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes
      negative . The diffusion of K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell actually
      <em>hyperpolarizes</em> the cell, in that the membrane potential
      becomes more negative than the cell’s normal resting potential. At
      this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting
      state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane
      potential again exceeds the threshold potential. In the absence of
      further neuronal stimulation, the sodium/potassium pump will move
      Na<sup>+</sup> out and K<sup>+</sup> in restoring concentration
      (high Na<sup>+</sup> outside and high K<sup>+</sup> inside) of the
      ions prior to the the action potential. Action potentials have a
      constant amplitude.&nbsp; Neurons thus encode and transmit
      information primarily through the frequency and patterns of action
      potentials, not in terms of action potential size .</p>

        potential in millivolts versus time. The membrane remains at the
        resting potential of -70 millivolts until a nerve impulse occurs
        in step 1. Some sodium channels open, and the potential begins
        to rapidly climb past the threshold of excitation of -55
        millivolts, at which point all the sodium channels open. At the
        peak action potential, the potential begins to rapidly drop as
        potassium channels open and sodium channels close. As a result,
        the membrane repolarizes past the resting membrane potential and
        becomes hyperpolarized. The membrane potential then gradually

      (4) The membrane becomes hyperpolarized as K<sup>+</sup> ions
      continue to leave the cell. The hyperpolarized membrane is in a

    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm251216928">Myelin and the Propagation of the
      Action Potential</h4>
    <p>For an action potential to communicate information to another
      neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals
      where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of
      conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by
      both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current
      leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from
      leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential
      conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis,
      action potential conduction slows because current leaks from
      previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated
      in Figure&nbsp;35.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon.
      These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and
      contain voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels.
      Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na<sup>+</sup>
      channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again
      along the axon. This ‘jumping’ of the action potential from one
      node to the next is called <em>saltatory conduction</em>. If
      nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action
      potential would propagate very slowly since Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>
      channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials
      at every point along the axon instead of at specific points. Nodes
      of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only
      need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon.</p>
    <p><img src="m44748/Figure_35_02_05.jpg" alt="Illustration shows an
        axon covered in three bands of myelin sheath. Between the sheath
        coverings the axon is exposed. The uncovered parts of the axon

        of Ranvier is depolarized such that the membrane potential is
        positive inside and negative outside. The right membrane of the
        right node is at the resting potential, negative inside and
        positive outside. An arrow indicates that the depolarization
        jumps from the left node to the right, so that the right node
        becomes depolarized."></p>

    </p>
    <p>1. Multiple sclerosis causes demyelination of axons in the brain
      and spinal cord. Why is this problematic?<br>

    <h3 id="m44748-fs-idm217900192">Synaptic Transmission</h3>
    <p>The synapse or “gap” is the place where information is
      transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form
      between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not
      universally true. There are also axon-to-axon,
      dendrite-to-dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron
      transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the
      neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron.
      Note that these designations are relative to a particular
      synapse—most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. There
      are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.</p>
    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm96975168">Chemical Synapse</h4>
    <p>When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes
      the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Na<sup>+</sup>
      ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic
      membrane. This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>
      channels to open. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a
      signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles,
      called <em>synaptic vesicles</em>, containing neurotransmitter
      molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Synaptic vesicles
      are shown in <a href="ch35.html#m44748-fig-ch35_02_06"

    <p>Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes
      neurotransmitter to be released into the <em>synaptic cleft</em>,
      the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic
      membranes, as illustrated in <a
        href="ch35.html#m44748-fig-ch35_02_07"
        title="Figure&nbsp;35.15.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;35.15</a>. The
      neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to
      receptor proteins on the postsynaptic membrane.</p>
    <p><img src="m44748/Figure_35_02_07.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a
        narrow axon of a presynaptic cell widening into a bulb-like axon
        terminal. A narrow synaptic cleft separates the axon terminal of
        the presynaptic cell from the postsynaptic cell. In step 1, an
        action potential arrives at the axon terminal. In step 2, the
        action potential causes voltage-gated calcium channels in the
        axon terminal open, allowing calcium to enter. In step 3,
        calcium influx causes neurotransmitter-containing synaptic
        vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane. Contents of the
        vesicles are released into the synaptic cleft by exocytosis. In
        step 4, neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and
        binds ligand-gated ion channels on the postsynaptic membrane,
        causing the channels to open. In step 5, the open channels cause
        ion movement into or out of the cell, resulting in a localized
        change in membrane potential. In step 6, reuptake by the
        presynaptic neuron, enzymatic degradation and diffusion reduce
        neurotransmitter levels, terminating the signal." width="500"
        height="630"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.15.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Communication at chemical synapses requires release of
      neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic membrane is depolarized,
      voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open and allow Ca<sup>2+</sup>
      to enter the cell. The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to
      fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into
      the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the
      synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-gated ion channels in the
      postsynaptic membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or
      hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
    <p>The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion
      channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the postsynaptic
      membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or
      inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane, as detailed in <a
        href="ch35.html#m44748-tab-ch35_02_01"
        title="Table&nbsp;35.1.&nbsp;The resting membrane potential is a
        result of different concentrations inside and outside the cell.">Table&nbsp;35.1</a>.
      For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between
      a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a
      presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na<sup>+</sup> channels
      to open. Na<sup>+</sup> enters the postsynaptic cell and causes
      the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is
      called an <em>excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)</em> and
      makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action
      potential. Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses
      causes <em>inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)</em>, a
      hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. For example, when
      the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released
      from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl<sup>-</sup>
      channels. Cl<sup>-</sup> ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes
      the membrane, making the neuron less likely to fire an action
      potential.</p>
    <p>Once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be
      removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic membrane can
      “reset” and be ready to receive another signal. This can be
      accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can diffuse away
      from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the
      synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake)
      by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of
      neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are given to
      Alzheimer’s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the
      enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme
      essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release
      acetylcholine. Once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft
      and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.</p>
    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm148735952">Electrical Synapse</h4>
    <p>While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical
      synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important
      and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical
      synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. In an
      electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are
      very close together and are actually physically connected by
      channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow
      current to pass directly from one cell to the next. In addition to
      the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP,
      can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.</p>
    <p>There are key differences between chemical and electrical
      synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release of
      neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their
      signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between
      when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when
      the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion
      channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional.
      Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually
      instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key
      reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional.
      Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely
      to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the
      electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical
      synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep,
      and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.</p>
    <h3 id="m44748-fs-idm245743248">Signal Summation</h3>
    <p>Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action
      potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple
      presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the
      postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an
      action potential. This process is called <em>summation</em> and
      occurs at the axon hillock, as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;35.16.
      Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic
      neurons—some excitatory and some inhibitory—so IPSPs can cancel
      out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic
      membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has
      reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action
      potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for
      excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is
      not transmitted as important information.</p>
    <p><img src="m44748/Figure_35_02_08.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the
        location of the axon hillock, which is the area connecting the
        neuron body to the axon. A graph shows the summation of membrane
        potentials at the axon hillock, plotted as membrane potential in
        millivolts versus time. Initially, the membrane potential at the
        axon hillock is -70 millivolts. A series of EPSPs and IPSPs
        cause the potential to rise and fall. Eventually, the potential
        increases to the threshold of excitation. At this point the
        nerve fires, resulting in a sharp increase in membrane
        potential, followed by a rapid decrease. The hillock becomes
        hyperpolarizes such that the membrane potential is lower than
        the resting potential. The hillock then gradually returns to the
        resting potential."></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.16.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs
      from multiple neurons, resulting in local membrane depolarization
      (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these inputs
      are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are strong
      enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of
      excitation, the neuron will fire.</p>

    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>central nervous system (CNS)</em> is made up of the
      brain and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of
      protective coverings called <em>meninges</em> (“meninges” is
      derived from the Greek and means “membranes”) (<a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Desktop/Concepts%20of%20Biology/content/ch16.html#m45539-fig-ch16_06_03"
        title="Figure&nbsp;16.21.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;16.21</a>). The
      outermost layer is the dura mater, the middle layer is the
      web-like arachnoid mater, and the inner layer is the pia mater,
      which directly contacts and covers the brain and spinal cord. The
      space between the arachnoid and pia maters is filled with <em>cerebrospinal


        fluid (CSF)</em>. The brain floats in CSF, which acts as a
      cushion and shock absorber.</p>
    <p><img src="m44749/Figure_35_03_01.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the
        three meninges that protect the brain. The outermost layer, just

    <h3 id="m44749-fs-idm230663440">Brain</h3>
    <p>The brain is the part of the central nervous system that is
      contained in the cranial cavity of the skull. It includes the
      cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus,
      hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and retinas. The outermost
      part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called
      the <em>cerebral cortex</em>. The cerebral cortex, limbic system,
      and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A thick
      fiber bundle called the <em>corpus callosum</em> (corpus =
      “body”; callosum = “tough”) connects the two hemispheres. Although
      there are some brain functions that are localized more to one
      hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres
      are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire
      hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do
      suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have
      surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is
      performed on children who have very immature nervous systems.</p>
    <p>In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum
      is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a
      condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique
      functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an object is
      presented to patients’ left visual field, they may be unable to
      verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object
      at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual
      field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then
      signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left
      side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked
      to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the
      left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be
      unable to verbally identify it.</p>
    <p><img src="m44749/Figure_35_03_02a.jpg" alt="Illustration shows
        coronal (front) and sagittal (side) sections of a human brain.
        In the coronal section, the large upper part of the brain,
        called the cerebral cortex, is divided into left and right
        hemispheres. A cavity resembling butterfly wings exists between
        the left and right cortex. The corpus callosum is a band that
        connects the two hemispheres together, just above this cavity.
        The surface of the cerebral cortex contains bumpy protrusions
        called gyri. The cerebral cortex is anchored by the brain stem,
        which connects with the spinal cord. On either side of the
        brainstem tucked beneath the cerebral cortex is the cerebellum.
        The surface of the cerebellum is bumpy, but not as bumpy as the
        cerebral cortex. The sagittal section reveals that the cerebral
        cortex makes up the front and top part of the brain, while the
        brainstem and cerebellum make up the lower back part. The oval
        thalamus sits in the cavity in the middle of the cerebral
        cortex. The corpus callosum wraps around the top part thalamus.
        The basal ganglia wraps around the corpus callosum, starting at
        the lower front part of the brain and continuing three-quarters
        of the way around so the back end almost meets the front end.
        The basal ganglia is separated into segments that are connected
        along the top and bottom. The amygdala is a spherical structure

        lobe is at the bottom center of the brain. The motor cortex is
        the back of the frontal lobe, and the olfactory bulb is the
        bottom part. The somatosensory cortex is the front part of the
        parietal lobe. The brainstem is beneath the temporal lobe, and
        the cerebellum is beneath the occipital lobe."></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.21.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal,
      temporal, and occipital lobes.</p>
    <p>The <em>frontal lobe</em> is located at the front of the brain,
      over the eyes. This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which
      processes smells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex,
      which is important for planning and implementing movement. Areas
      within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups. Neurons in
      the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining
      attention, speech, and decision-making. Studies of humans who have
      damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are
      involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk.</p>
    <p><img src="m44749/Figure_35_03_04.jpg" alt="Diagram shows the
        location of motor control for various muscle groups on the right
        hemisphere cerebral cortex. From the top middle of the motor
        cortex to the bottom right, the order of areas controlled is
        toes, ankles, knees, hips, trunk, shoulders, elbows, wrists,
        hands, fingers, thumbs, neck, eyebrows and eyelids, eyeballs,
        face, lips, jaw, tongue, salivation, chewing and swallowing."></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.22.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Different parts of the motor cortex control different muscle
      groups. Muscle groups that are neighbors in the body are generally
      controlled by neighboring regions of the motor cortex as well. For
      example, the neurons that control finger movement are near the
      neurons that control hand movement.</p>
    <p>The <em>parietal lobe</em> is located at the top of the brain.
      Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also
      reading. Two of the parietal lobe’s main functions are processing
      somatosensation—touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat,
      cold—and processing proprioception—the sense of how parts of the
      body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains a
      somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex. The <em>occipital


        lobe</em> is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily
      involved in vision—seeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual
      world. The <em>temporal lobe</em> is located at the base of the
      brain and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting
      sounds. It also contains the <em>hippocampus</em> (named from the
      Greek for “seahorse,” which it resembles in shape) a structure
      that processes memory formation. The role of the hippocampus in
      memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic
      patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an
      attempt to cure his epilepsy. His seizures went away, but he could
      no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts
      from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks).</p>
    <p>Interconnected brain areas called the <em>basal ganglia</em>
      play important roles in movement control and posture. The basal
      ganglia also regulate motivation.</p>
    <p>The <em>thalamus</em> acts as a gateway to and from the cortex.
      It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also
      receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can
      modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending
      on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus
      helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states.</p>

      the pituitary gland. Among other functions, the hypothalamus is
      the body’s thermostat—it makes sure the body temperature is kept
      at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also
      regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.</p>
    <p>The <em>limbic system</em> is a connected set of structures that
      regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and
      motivation. It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts
      of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One
      important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe
      structure called the <em>amygdala</em>. The two amygdala (one on
      each side) are important both for the sensation of fear and for
      recognizing fearful faces.</p>
    <p>The <em>cerebellum</em> (cerebellum = “little brain”) sits at
      the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The cerebellum
      controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning
      new motor tasks. The cerebellum of birds is large compared to
      other vertebrates because of the coordination required by flight.</p>
    <p>The <em>brainstem</em> connects the rest of the brain with the
      spinal cord and regulates some of the most important and basic
      functions of the nervous system including breathing, swallowing,
      digestion, sleeping, walking, and sensory and motor information
      integration.</p>
    <h3 id="m44749-fs-idm87091520">Spinal Cord</h3>
    <p>Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through
      the spinal column is the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a thick
      bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to
      the brain and from the brain to the body. The spinal cord is
      contained within the meninges and the bones of the vertebral
      column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body
      through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral
      nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a
      white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape (Figure 35.25). Axons
      make up the “white matter” and neuron and glia cell bodies (and
      interneurons) make up the “gray matter.” Axons and cell bodies in
      the dorsa spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the
      body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the spinal cord
      primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to
      the body.</p>
    <p>The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are
      quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a hand
      from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local
      synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a doctor
      tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse
      between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a reflex may
      only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with
      interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the
      brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was
      hot).</p>
    <p><img src="m44749/Figure_35_03_07.jpg" alt="In the cross section
        the gray matter forms an X inside the oval white matter. The
        legs of the X are thicker than the arms. Each leg is called a
        ventral horn, and each arm is called a dorsal horn."></p>

      cell bodies and interneurons) and white matter (containing axons).</p>
    <h2 id="m44751">The Peripheral Nervous System</h2>
    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>The <em>peripheral nervous system (PNS)</em> is the connection
      between the central nervous system and the rest of the body. The
      PNS can be broken down into the <em>autonomic nervous system</em>,
      which controls bodily functions without conscious control, and the
      <em>sensory-somatic nervous system</em>, which transmits sensory
      information from the skin, muscles, and sensory organs to the CNS
      and sends motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.</p>
    <h3 id="m44751-fs-idp90728576">Autonomic Nervous System</h3>
    <p><img src="m44751/Figure_35_04_01f.png" alt="The autonomic nervous
        system is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.
        In the sympathetic system, the soma of the preganglionic neurons
        is usually located in the spine while in the parasympathetic
        system the soma is usually in the brainstem or sacral, at the
        bottom of the spine. In both systems, the preganglionic neuron
        releases the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into the synapse.
        Postganglionic neurons of the sympathetic system have somas in a
        sympathetic ganglion, located next to the spinal cord.
        Postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system have somas
        in ganglions near the target organ. Postganglionic neurons of
        the sympathetic system release norepinephrine into the synapse,
        while postganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system
        release acetylcholine or nitric oxide." width="500" height="664"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.26.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In the autonomic nervous system, a preganglionic neuron of the
      CNS synapses with a postganglionic neuron of the PNS. The
      postganglionic neuron, in turn, acts on a target organ. Autonomic
      responses are mediated by the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
      systems, which are antagonistic to one another. The sympathetic
      system activates the “fight or flight” response, while the
      parasympathetic system activates the “rest and digest” response.</p>
    <p>Which of the following statements is false?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>The parasympathetic pathway is responsible for resting the
          body, while the sympathetic pathway is responsible for
          preparing for an emergency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Most preganglionic neurons in the sympathetic pathway
          originate in the spinal cord.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Slowing of the heartbeat is a parasympathetic response.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Parasympathetic neurons are responsible for releasing
          norepinephrine on the target organ, while sympathetic neurons
          are responsible for releasing acetylcholine.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The autonomic nervous system serves as the relay between the CNS
      and the internal organs. It controls the lungs, the heart, smooth
      muscle, and exocrine and endocrine glands. The autonomic nervous
      system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it
      can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems
      and implement changes as needed. Signaling to the target tissue
      usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating
      in the CNS) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn,
      synapses on the target organ (Figure 35.27). There are two
      divisions of the autonomic nervous system that often have opposing
      effects: the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic
      nervous system.</p>
    <p>The <em>sympathetic nervous system</em> is responsible for the
      immediate responses an animal makes when it encounters a dangerous
      situation. One way to remember this is to think of the
      “fight-or-flight” response a person feels when encountering a
      snake (“snake” and “sympathetic” both begin with “s”). Examples of
      functions controlled by the sympathetic nervous system include an
      accelerated heart rate and inhibited digestion. These functions
      help prepare an organism’s body for the physical strain required
      to escape a potentially dangerous situation or to fend off a
      predator.</p>
    <p><img src="m44751/Figure_35_04_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the
        effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems on target
        organs, and the placement of the preganglionic neurons that
        mediate these effects. The parasympathetic system causes pupils
        and bronchi to constrict, slows the heart rate, and stimulates
        salivation, digestion, and bile secretion. Preganglionic neurons
        that mediate these effects are all located in the brain stem.
        Preganglionic neurons of the parasympathetic system that are
        located in the sacral cause the bladder to contract. The
        sympathetic system causes pupils and bronchi to dilate,
        increases heart rate, inhibits digestion, stimulates the
        breakdown of glycogen and the secretion of adrenaline and
        noradrenaline, and inhibits contraction of the bladder. The
        preganglionic neurons that mediate these effects are all located
        in the spine." width="500" height="484"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.27.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems often have
      opposing effects on target organs.</p>
    <p>While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful
      situations, the <em>parasympathetic nervous system</em> allows an
      animal to “rest and digest.” One way to remember this is to think
      that during a restful situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic
      nervous system is in control (“picnic” and “parasympathetic” both
      start with “p”). Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell
      bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the
      bottom) spinal cord (<a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Desktop/Concepts%20of%20Biology/content/ch16.html#m45539-fig-ch16_06_07"
        title="Figure&nbsp;16.25.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;16.25</a>). The
      parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the
      sympathetic nervous system is activated including slowing of heart
      rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.</p>
    <p>The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and
      spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons. Sensory
      neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal
      muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons transmit
      messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to
      make them contract. Without its sensory-somatic nervous system, an
      animal would be unable to process any information about its
      environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not
      control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system,
      which usually has two synapses between the CNS and the target
      organ, sensory and motor neurons usually have only one synapse—one
      ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly
      contacts a CNS neuron.</p>
    <p><strong>Questions to answer:</strong><br>
    </p>
    <p>1. What methods can be used to determine the function of a
      particular brain region?<br>
    </p>
    <p>2. What are the main functions of the spinal cord?<br>
      <br>
      3. What are the main differences between the sympathetic and
      parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system?<br>
      <br>
      4. Speculate on the actions of neurotoxins and poisons and how
      these molecules might interfere with the function(s) of neurons
      and the nervous system.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      5. Why do you think surgeries to treat brain and nervous system
      disorders have surprisingly few problems, especially when the
      surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous
      systems? <br>
      <br>
      6. Why do you think there is a difference in the number of
      synapses in neurons of the autonomic and sensory-somatic (sensory
      and motor neurons) nervous systems? <br>
