    <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and
      allow for a wide range of movement. The bones of the skeletal
      system protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight
      of the body. The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull
      on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing,
      walking, running, and grasping items.</p>
    <p>Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be
      very debilitating. In humans, the most common musculoskeletal
      diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. Ailments that
      affect the joints are also widespread, such as arthritis, which
      can make movement difficult and—in advanced cases—completely
      impair mobility. In severe cases in which the joint has suffered
      extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed.</p>
    <p>Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the
      development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery
      in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints
      for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available. Even with
      this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design
      of prostheses. The state-of-the-art prostheses have limited
      durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young
      or active individuals. Current research is focused on the use of
      new materials, such as carbon fiber, that may make prostheses more
      durable.</p>
    <h2 id="m44788">Muscle Contraction and Locomotion</h2>
    Muscle cells are specialized for contraction. Muscles allow for
    motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes
    such as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of
    muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (<a

    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_01.jpg" alt="The skeletal muscle
        cells are long and arranged in parallel bands that give the
        appearance of striations. Each cell has a multiple nuclei.
        Smooth muscle cells have no striations and only one nuclei per
        cell. Cardiac muscles are striated but have only one nucleus."

    <p>The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle,
      smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle, visualized here using light
      microscopy. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end,
      and have only one plump nucleus in each. Cardiac muscle cells are
      branched and striated, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, and
      they have one nucleus in the center of the cell. (credit:
      modification of work by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt
      Russell)</p>
    <p><em>Skeletal muscle tissue</em> forms skeletal muscles, which
      attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement
      that can be consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled
      by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle.
      Skeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when
      viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or
      striated appearance. The striations are caused by the regular
      arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin). <em>Actin</em>
      is a globular contractile protein that interacts with <em>myosin</em>
      for muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei
      present in a single cell.</p>
    <p><em>Smooth muscle tissue</em> occurs in the walls of hollow
      organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and
      around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels.
      Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control,
      has only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is
      called involuntary muscle.</p>
    <p><em>Cardiac muscle tissue</em> is only found in the heart, and
      cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain
      blood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated,
      but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously
      controlled and is called involuntary muscle. It has one nucleus
      per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the presence of
      intercalated disks.</p>
    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm71421024">Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure</h3>
    <p>Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells
      are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 µm and lengths
      of up to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is
      specialized and called the <em>sarcolemma</em>. The sarcolemma is
      the site of action potential conduction (like the cell membrane of
      neurons), which triggers muscle contraction (more later). Within
      each muscle fiber are <em>myofibrils</em>—long cylindrical
      structures that lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run
      the entire length of the muscle fiber, and because they are only
      approximately 1.2 µm in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be
      found inside one muscle fiber. They attach to the sarcolemma at
      their ends, so that as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell
      contracts (<a href="ch38.html#m44788-fig-ch38_04_02"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.34.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.34</a>).</p>
    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a
        long, tubular skeletal muscle cell that runs the length of a
        muscle fiber. Bundles of fibers called myofibrils run the length
        of the cell. The myofibrils have a banded appearance."
        width="550" height="215"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;38.34.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>A skeletal muscle cell is surrounded by a plasma membrane called
      the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm. A muscle
      fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.</p>
    <p>The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of
      repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are present
      along the length of myofibrils. Dark A bands and light I bands
      repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the
      cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the
      middle called Z line. The Z lines mark the border of units called
      <em>sarcomeres</em>, which are the functional units of skeletal
      muscle. One sarcomere is the space between two consecutive Z
      lines. A myofibril is composed of many sarcomeres running along
      its length, and as the sarcomeres individually contract, the
      myofibrils and muscle cells shorten (<a

    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_03.jpg" alt="Illustration shows
        part of a tubular myofibril, which consists of many sarcomeres.
        Zigzagging lines, called Z lines, run perpendicular to the
        fiber. Each sarcomere starts at one Z line and ends at the next.
        A straight perpendicular line, called an M line, exists halfway
        between each Z line. Thick filaments extend out from the M
        lines, parallel to the length of the myofibril. Thin filaments
        extend from the Z lines, and extend into the space between the
        thick filaments."></p>

    <p>A sarcomere is the region from one Z line to the next Z line.
      Many sarcomeres are present in a myofibril, resulting in the
      striation pattern characteristic of skeletal muscle.</p>
    <p>Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called <em>myofilaments</em>.
      There are two main types of filaments: thick filaments and thin
      filaments. Thick and thin filaments are composed of proteins.
      Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The tail of a
      myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the
      central region of a thick filament near the M line, whereas the
      heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin
      filaments overlap. The primary component of thin filaments is the
      actin protein. <br>

    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm188124656">Sliding Filament Model of
      Contraction</h3>
    <p>For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten.
      However, thick and thin filaments—the components of sarcomeres—do
      not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the
      sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length.
      The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to
      fit the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere
      at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. The
      mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin,
      forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (<a
        href="ch38.html#m44788-fig-ch38_04_04"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.36.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.36</a>).</p>
    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_04.jpg" alt="Part A of the
        illustration shows a relaxed muscle fiber. Two zigzagging Z
        lines extend from top to bottom. Thin actin filaments extend
        left and right from each Z line. Between the Z lines is a
        vertical M line. Thick myosin filaments extend left and right
        from the M line. The thick and thin filaments partially overlap.
        The A band represents the length that the thick filaments extend
        from both sides of the M line. The I band represents the part of
        the thin filaments that does not overlap with the thick
        filaments. Part B shows a contracted muscle fiber. In the
        contracted fiber, the thick and thin filaments completely
        overlap. The A band is the same length as in the uncontracted
        muscle, but the I band has shrunken to the width of the Z line."
        width="550" height="493"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;38.36.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer
      together and the I band gets smaller. The A band stays the same
      width and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.</p>
    <p>When a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others
      stay the same length. When a muscle contracts, the distance
      between the Z discs is reduced. The H zone—the central region of
      the A zone—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during
      contraction. The I band contains only thin filaments and also
      shortens. The A band does not shorten—it remains the same
      length—but A bands of different sarcomeres move closer together
      during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are
      pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere
      until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of
      overlap, in which thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the
      same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.</p>
