    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm71940272">Action Potential</h4>
    <p>A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input
      is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons.
      Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a
      chemical called a neurotransmitter (more later). Transmission of a
      signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried
      by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an <em>action



        potential</em>. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to
      receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, ion channels open. This
      opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in <em>depolarization</em>
      of the membrane—a decrease in the difference in voltage between
      the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory
      cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its
      threshold potential (-55 mV). Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the axon
      hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell
      (Figure&nbsp;35.10 and Figure&nbsp;35.11). Once the sodium
      channels are completely open, the neuron completely depolarizes to
      a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are
      considered an “all-or nothing” event, in that, once the threshold
      potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes.
      Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now “reset” its
      membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish
      this, the Na<sup>+</sup> channels close and cannot be opened. This
      begins the neuron’s <em>refractory period</em>, in which it
      cannot produce another action potential because its sodium
      channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup>
      channels open, allowing K<sup>+</sup> to leave the cell. As K<sup>+</sup>
      ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes
      negative . The diffusion of K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell actually
      <em>hyperpolarizes</em> the cell, in that the membrane potential
      becomes more negative than the cell’s normal resting potential. At
      this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting
      state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane
      potential again exceeds the threshold potential. In the absence of
      further neuronal stimulation, the sodium/potassium pump will move
      Na<sup>+</sup> out and K<sup>+</sup> in restoring concentration
      (high Na<sup>+</sup> outside and high K<sup>+</sup> inside) of the
      ions prior to the the action potential. Action potentials have a
      constant amplitude.&nbsp; Neurons thus encode and transmit
      information primarily through the frequency and patterns of action
      potentials, not in terms of action potential size .</p>

        The membrane remains at the resting potential of -70 millivolts
        until a nerve impulse occurs in step 1. Some sodium channels
        open, and the potential begins to rapidly climb past the
        threshold of excitation of -55 millivolts, at which point all
        the sodium channels open. At the peak action potential, the
        potential begins to rapidly drop as potassium channels open and
        sodium channels close. As a result, the membrane repolarizes
        past the resting membrane potential and becomes hyperpolarized.

    <p>The formation of an action potential can be divided into five
      steps: (1) A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron causes
      the target cell to depolarize toward the threshold potential. (2)
      If the threshold of excitation is reached, all Na<sup>+</sup>
      channels open and the membrane depolarizes. (3) At the peak action
      potential, K<sup>+</sup> channels open and K<sup>+</sup> begins to
      leave the cell. At the same time, Na<sup>+</sup> channels close.
      (4) The membrane becomes hyperpolarized as K<sup>+</sup> ions
      continue to leave the cell. The hyperpolarized membrane is in a
      refractory period and cannot fire. (5) The K<sup>+</sup> channels
      close and the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> transporter restores
      the resting potential.</p>

    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm251216928">Myelin and the Propagation of the
      Action Potential</h4>
    <p>For an action potential to communicate information to another
      neuron, it must travel along the axon and reach the axon terminals
      where it can initiate neurotransmitter release. The speed of
      conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by
      both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current
      leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from
      leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential
      conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis,
      action potential conduction slows because current leaks from
      previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated
      in Figure&nbsp;35.13 are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon.
      These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and
      contain voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels.
      Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na<sup>+</sup>
      channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again
      along the axon. This ‘jumping’ of the action potential from one
      node to the next is called <em>saltatory conduction</em>. If
      nodes of Ranvier were not present along an axon, the action
      potential would propagate very slowly since Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup>
      channels would have to continuously regenerate action potentials
      at every point along the axon instead of at specific points. Nodes
      of Ranvier also save energy for the neuron since the channels only
      need to be present at the nodes and not along the entire axon.</p>

        the membrane potential is positive inside and negative outside.
        The right membrane of the right node is at the resting
        potential, negative inside and positive outside. An arrow

    </p>
    <p>1. Multiple sclerosis causes demyelination of axons in the brain
      and spinal cord. Why is this problematic?<br>

      axon? How do the nodes of Ranvier help this process? </p>
    <h3 id="m44748-fs-idm217900192">Synaptic Transmission</h3>
    <p>The synapse or “gap” is the place where information is
      transmitted from one neuron to another. Synapses usually form
      between axon terminals and dendritic spines, but this is not
      universally true. There are also axon-to-axon,
      dendrite-to-dendrite, and axon-to-cell body synapses. The neuron
      transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the
      neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron.
      Note that these designations are relative to a particular
      synapse—most neurons are both presynaptic and postsynaptic. There
      are two types of synapses: chemical and electrical.</p>
    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm96975168">Chemical Synapse</h4>
    <p>When an action potential reaches the axon terminal it depolarizes
      the membrane and opens voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels. Na<sup>+</sup>
      ions enter the cell, further depolarizing the presynaptic
      membrane. This depolarization causes voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup>
      channels to open. Calcium ions entering the cell initiate a
      signaling cascade that causes small membrane-bound vesicles,
      called <em>synaptic vesicles</em>, containing neurotransmitter
      molecules to fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Synaptic vesicles
      are shown in <a

    <p>Fusion of a vesicle with the presynaptic membrane causes
      neurotransmitter to be released into the <em>synaptic cleft</em>,
      the extracellular space between the presynaptic and postsynaptic
      membranes, as illustrated in <a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Documents/markclements/website/HumanBio/ch35.html#m44748-fig-ch35_02_07"

        alt="Illustration shows a narrow axon of a presynaptic cell
        widening into a bulb-like axon terminal. A narrow synaptic cleft
        separates the axon terminal of the presynaptic cell from the
        postsynaptic cell. In step 1, an action potential arrives at the
        axon terminal. In step 2, the action potential causes
        voltage-gated calcium channels in the axon terminal open,
        allowing calcium to enter. In step 3, calcium influx causes
        neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles to fuse with the
        plasma membrane. Contents of the vesicles are released into the
        synaptic cleft by exocytosis. In step 4, neurotransmitter
        diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds ligand-gated ion
        channels on the postsynaptic membrane, causing the channels to
        open. In step 5, the open channels cause ion movement into or
        out of the cell, resulting in a localized change in membrane
        potential. In step 6, reuptake by the presynaptic neuron,
        enzymatic degradation and diffusion reduce neurotransmitter
        levels, terminating the signal." width="500" height="630"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;35.15.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Communication at chemical synapses requires release of
      neurotransmitters. When the presynaptic membrane is depolarized,
      voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels open and allow Ca<sup>2+</sup>
      to enter the cell. The calcium entry causes synaptic vesicles to
      fuse with the membrane and release neurotransmitter molecules into
      the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the
      synaptic cleft and binds to ligand-gated ion channels in the
      postsynaptic membrane, resulting in a localized depolarization or
      hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic neuron.</p>
    <p>The binding of a specific neurotransmitter causes particular ion
      channels, in this case ligand-gated channels, on the postsynaptic
      membrane to open. Neurotransmitters can either have excitatory or
      inhibitory effects on the postsynaptic membrane, as detailed in <a
href="file:///Users/scartomyzon/Documents/markclements/website/HumanBio/ch35.html#m44748-tab-ch35_02_01"
        title="Table&nbsp;35.1.&nbsp;The resting membrane potential is a
        result of different concentrations inside and outside the cell.">Table&nbsp;35.1</a>.
      For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between
      a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a
      presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na<sup>+</sup> channels
      to open. Na<sup>+</sup> enters the postsynaptic cell and causes
      the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is
      called an <em>excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)</em> and
      makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action
      potential. Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses
      causes <em>inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)</em>, a
      hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. For example, when
      the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released
      from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl<sup>-</sup>
      channels. Cl<sup>-</sup> ions enter the cell and hyperpolarizes
      the membrane, making the neuron less likely to fire an action
      potential.</p>
    <p>Once neurotransmission has occurred, the neurotransmitter must be
      removed from the synaptic cleft so the postsynaptic membrane can
      “reset” and be ready to receive another signal. This can be
      accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can diffuse away
      from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the
      synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake)
      by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of
      neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are given to
      Alzheimer’s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the
      enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme
      essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release
      acetylcholine. Once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft
      and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.</p>
    <h4 id="m44748-fs-idm148735952">Electrical Synapse</h4>
    <p>While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical
      synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important
      and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical
      synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. In an
      electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are
      very close together and are actually physically connected by
      channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow
      current to pass directly from one cell to the next. In addition to
      the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP,
      can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.</p>
    <p>There are key differences between chemical and electrical
      synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release of
      neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their
      signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between
      when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when
      the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion
      channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional.
      Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually
      instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key
      reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional.
      Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely
      to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the
      electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical
      synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep,
      and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.</p>
    <h3 id="m44748-fs-idm245743248">Signal Summation</h3>
    <p>Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action
      potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple
      presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the
      postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an
      action potential. This process is called <em>summation</em> and
      occurs at the axon hillock, as illustrated in Figure&nbsp;35.16.
      Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic
      neurons—some excitatory and some inhibitory—so IPSPs can cancel
      out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic
      membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has
      reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action
      potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for
      excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is
      not transmitted as important information.</p>

        shows the summation of membrane potentials at the axon hillock,
        plotted as membrane potential in millivolts versus time.
        Initially, the membrane potential at the axon hillock is -70
        millivolts. A series of EPSPs and IPSPs cause the potential to
        rise and fall. Eventually, the potential increases to the
        threshold of excitation. At this point the nerve fires,
        resulting in a sharp increase in membrane potential, followed by
        a rapid decrease. The hillock becomes hyperpolarizes such that
        the membrane potential is lower than the resting potential. The
        hillock then gradually returns to the resting potential."></p>

    <p>A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs
      from multiple neurons, resulting in local membrane depolarization
      (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input). All these inputs
      are added together at the axon hillock. If the EPSPs are strong
      enough to overcome the IPSPs and reach the threshold of
      excitation, the neuron will fire.</p>
