    <p>An <em>endoskeleton</em> is a skeleton that consists of hard,
      mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of
      organisms. Endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect
      internal organs, and allow for movement through contraction of
      muscles attached to the skeleton.</p>

    <p>The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones
      in the adult. It has five main functions: providing support to the
      body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells,
      protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The
      skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton
      (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and
      the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb
      bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).</p>

    <p>The <em>axial skeleton</em> forms the central axis of the body
      and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear,
      hyoid bone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage
      (ribcage) (<a href="ch38.html#m44781-fig-ch38_01_04"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.5.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.5</a>). The
      function of the axial skeleton is to provide support and
      protection for the brain, the spinal cord, and the organs in the
      ventral body cavity. It provides a surface for the attachment of
      muscles that move the head, neck, and trunk, performs respiratory
      movements, and stabilizes parts of the appendicular skeleton.</p>

    <h3 id="m44781-fs-idm147139328">Human Appendicular Skeleton</h3>
    <p>The <em>appendicular skeleton</em> is composed of the bones of
      the upper limbs (which function to grasp and manipulate objects)
      and the lower limbs (which permit locomotion). It also includes
      the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the upper
      limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower
      limbs to the body (<a href="ch38.html#m44781-fig-ch38_01_09"

    <h2 id="m44789">Bone</h2>
    <em>Bone</em>, or <em>osseous tissue</em>, is a connective tissue
    that constitutes the endoskeleton. It contains specialized cells and
    a matrix of mineral salts and collagen (protein) fibers.
    <p>The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral
      formed from calcium phosphate. <em>Calcification</em> is the
      process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen (protein)
      fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. The process
      of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers.</p>
    <p>The bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape:
      long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid
      bones, and irregular bones (<a
        href="ch38.html#m44789-fig-ch38_02_01"

        classification of different bone types. The sternum at the
        front, middle of the rib cage is a flat bone. The femur is a
        long bone. The patella is a sesamoid bone. The vertebrae are
        irregular bones, and the bones of the foot are short bones."

    <h3 id="m44789-fs-idm5626320">Bone Tissue</h3>
    <p>Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of
      tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue.
      Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral
      matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact and
      spongy.</p>
    <h4 id="m44789-fs-idm149839456">Compact Bone Tissue</h4>
    <p><em>Compact bone</em> (or cortical bone) forms the hard external
      layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone
      marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone
      tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. <em>Osteons</em>
      are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and
      living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood.
      They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each
      osteon consists of <em>lamellae</em>, which are layers of compact
      matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal.
      The <em>Haversian canal</em> (osteonic canal) contains the bone’s
      blood vessels and nerve fibers (<a
        href="ch38.html#m44789-fig-ch38_02_04"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.19.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.19</a>). Osteons
      in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along
      lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing.
      Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at
      which stresses are applied in only a few directions.</p>

    <p><img src="m44789/Figure_38_02_04.png" alt="Illustration shows a
        cross-section of a bone. The compact outer part of the bone is
        made up of cylindrical osteons that run its length. Each osteon
        is made up of a matrix of lamellae that surround a central
        Haversian canal. Arteries, veins and nerve fibers run through
        the Haversian canals. The spongy inner bone consists of porous
        trabeculae."></p>

      ovals in the osteon represent the living osteocytes. (credit:

    <p>Which of the following statements about bone tissue is false?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Compact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are
          aligned such that they travel the length of the bone.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Haversian canals contain blood vessels only.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Haversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Spongy tissue is found on the interior of the bone, and
          compact bone tissue is found on the exterior.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="m44789-fs-idp27296784">Spongy Bone Tissue</h4>
    <p>Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, <em>spongy






        bone</em> or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones.
      Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute
      compact bone tissue. Instead, it consists of <em>trabeculae</em>,
      which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. Red bone
      marrow is found between the trabuculae. Blood vessels within this
      tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. The red
      bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large bones,
      such as the ileum, forms blood cells.</p>
    <p>Spongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of
      long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied to the
      bone. Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not
      heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions.
      The epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject
      to stress from many directions. Imagine laying a heavy framed
      picture flat on the floor. You could hold up one side of the
      picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the
      floor and the picture. Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick
      into the wall to hang up the picture. In this case, the function
      of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the
      picture to the wall. The force on the picture is straight down to
      the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire
      pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up.
      The toothpick will break off right at the wall.</p>
    <p>The neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the
      wall. The weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but
      the vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end.
      The neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer the
      downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical
      shaft of the femur (<a href="ch38.html#m44789-fig-ch38_02_05"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.20.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.20</a>).</p>

        tension lines in a long bone, which start out perpendicular to
        the epiphysis and then turn and run along the length of the
        bone. Compression lines run the length of the bone opposite the
        side of the tension lines." width="400" height="386"></p>

    <h2 id="m44786">Joints and Skeletal Movement</h2>
    <p>The point at which two or more bones meet is called a <em>joint</em>,
      or <em>articulation</em>. Joints are responsible for movement,
      such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the
      stability found in the bones of the skull.</p>
    <h3 id="m44786-fs-idp156819008">Classification of Joints on the
      Basis of Structure</h3>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <p>There are two ways to classify joints: based on their structure
      or based on their function. The structural classification divides
      joints into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending
      on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of
      a cavity in the joint. The bones of fibrous joints are held
      together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or
      space, present between the bones, so most fibrous joints do not
      move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. The joints
      between the bones in the skull and between the teeth and the bone
      of their sockets are examples of fibrous joints (<span class="xref
        target-figure">Figure&nbsp;16.16</span><span class="bold"><strong>a</strong></span>).</p>
    <p><span id="m45538-fs-idp114355648"> </span><em class="glossterm"><span
          id="m45538-autoid-cnx2dbk-id962606"> </span>Cartilaginous
        joints</em><a id="id570040" class="indexterm"> are joints in
        which the bones are connected by cartilage (</a><span
        class="xref target-figure">Figure&nbsp;16.16</span><span
        class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>). An example is found at
      the joints between vertebrae, the so-called “disks” of the
      backbone. Cartilaginous joints allow for very little movement.</p>
    <p><span id="m45538-fs-idm1195888"> </span><em class="glossterm"><span
          id="m45538-autoid-cnx2dbk-id962626"> </span>Synovial joints</em><a
        id="id570080" class="indexterm"> are the only joints that have a
        space between the adjoining bones (</a><span class="xref
        target-figure">Figure&nbsp;16.16</span><span class="bold"><strong>c</strong></span>).





      This space is referred to as the joint cavity and is filled with
      fluid. The fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between
      the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones
      are covered with cartilage and the entire joint is surrounded by a
      capsule. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of
      the joint types. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of
      synovial joints.<br>
