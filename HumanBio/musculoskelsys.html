    <h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
    <p>The muscular and skeletal systems provide support to the body and
      allow for a wide range of movement. The bones of the skeletal
      system protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight
      of the body. The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull
      on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing,
      walking, running, and grasping items.</p>
    <p>Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be
      very debilitating. In humans, the most common musculoskeletal
      diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. Ailments that
      affect the joints are also widespread, such as arthritis, which
      can make movement difficult and—in advanced cases—completely
      impair mobility. In severe cases in which the joint has suffered
      extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed.</p>
    <p>Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the
      development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery
      in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints
      for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available. Even with
      this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design
      of prostheses. The state-of-the-art prostheses have limited
      durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young
      or active individuals. Current research is focused on the use of
      new materials, such as carbon fiber, that may make prostheses more
      durable.</p>
    <h3 id="m44781-fs-idp74171488">Endoskeleton</h3>
    <p>An <em>endoskeleton</em> is a skeleton that consists of hard,
      mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of
      organisms. Endoskeletons provide support for the body, protect
      internal organs, and allow for movement through contraction of
      muscles attached to the skeleton.</p>

    <p>The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones
      in the adult. It has five main functions: providing support to the
      body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells,
      protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The
      skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton
      (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and
      the appendicular skeleton (which consists of the shoulders, limb
      bones, the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle).</p>

    <h3 id="m44781-fs-idm105683952">Human Axial Skeleton</h3>
    <p>The <em>axial skeleton</em> forms the central axis of the body
      and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear,
      hyoid bone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage
      (ribcage) (<a href="ch38.html#m44781-fig-ch38_01_04"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.5.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.5</a>). The
      function of the axial skeleton is to provide support and
      protection for the brain, the spinal cord, and the organs in the
      ventral body cavity. It provides a surface for the attachment of
      muscles that move the head, neck, and trunk, performs respiratory
      movements, and stabilizes parts of the appendicular skeleton.</p>

    <h3 id="m44781-fs-idm147139328">Human Appendicular Skeleton</h3>
    <p>The <em>appendicular skeleton</em> is composed of the bones of
      the upper limbs (which function to grasp and manipulate objects)
      and the lower limbs (which permit locomotion). It also includes
      the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the upper
      limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower
      limbs to the body (<a href="ch38.html#m44781-fig-ch38_01_09"

    <h2 id="m44789">Bone</h2>
    <em>Bone</em>, or <em>osseous tissue</em>, is a connective tissue
    that constitutes the endoskeleton. It contains specialized cells and
    a matrix of mineral salts and collagen (protein) fibers.
    <p>The mineral salts primarily include hydroxyapatite, a mineral
      formed from calcium phosphate. <em>Calcification</em> is the
      process of deposition of mineral salts on the collagen (protein)
      fiber matrix that crystallizes and hardens the tissue. The process
      of calcification only occurs in the presence of collagen fibers.</p>
    <p>The bones of the human skeleton are classified by their shape:
      long bones, short bones, flat bones, sutural bones, sesamoid
      bones, and irregular bones (<a
        href="ch38.html#m44789-fig-ch38_02_01"

        classification of different bone types. The sternum at the
        front, middle of the rib cage is a flat bone. The femur is a
        long bone. The patella is a sesamoid bone. The vertebrae are
        irregular bones, and the bones of the foot are short bones."

      and sesamoid.</p>
    <h3 id="m44789-fs-idm5626320">Bone Tissue</h3>
    <p>Bones are considered organs because they contain various types of
      tissue, such as blood, connective tissue, nerves, and bone tissue.
      Osteocytes, the living cells of bone tissue, form the mineral
      matrix of bones. There are two types of bone tissue: compact and
      spongy.</p>
    <h4 id="m44789-fs-idm149839456">Compact Bone Tissue</h4>
    <p><em>Compact bone</em> (or cortical bone) forms the hard external
      layer of all bones and surrounds the medullary cavity, or bone
      marrow. It provides protection and strength to bones. Compact bone
      tissue consists of units called osteons or Haversian systems. <em>Osteons</em>
      are cylindrical structures that contain a mineral matrix and
      living osteocytes connected by canaliculi, which transport blood.
      They are aligned parallel to the long axis of the bone. Each
      osteon consists of <em>lamellae</em>, which are layers of compact
      matrix that surround a central canal called the Haversian canal.
      The <em>Haversian canal</em> (osteonic canal) contains the bone’s
      blood vessels and nerve fibers (<a
        href="ch38.html#m44789-fig-ch38_02_04"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.19.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.19</a>). Osteons
      in compact bone tissue are aligned in the same direction along
      lines of stress and help the bone resist bending or fracturing.
      Therefore, compact bone tissue is prominent in areas of bone at
      which stresses are applied in only a few directions.</p>
    <p>Art Connection</p>
    <p><img src="m44789/Figure_38_02_04.png" alt="Illustration shows a
        cross-section of a bone. The compact outer part of the bone is
        made up of cylindrical osteons that run its length. Each osteon
        is made up of a matrix of lamellae that surround a central
        Haversian canal. Arteries, veins and nerve fibers run through
        the Haversian canals. The spongy inner bone consists of porous
        trabeculae."></p>

      ovals in the osteon represent the living osteocytes. (credit:

    <p>Which of the following statements about bone tissue is false?</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Compact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are
          aligned such that they travel the length of the bone.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Haversian canals contain blood vessels only.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Haversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Spongy tissue is found on the interior of the bone, and
          compact bone tissue is found on the exterior.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4 id="m44789-fs-idp27296784">Spongy Bone Tissue</h4>
    <p>Whereas compact bone tissue forms the outer layer of all bones, <em>spongy





        bone</em> or cancellous bone forms the inner layer of all bones.
      Spongy bone tissue does not contain osteons that constitute
      compact bone tissue. Instead, it consists of <em>trabeculae</em>,
      which are lamellae that are arranged as rods or plates. Red bone
      marrow is found between the trabuculae. Blood vessels within this
      tissue deliver nutrients to osteocytes and remove waste. The red
      bone marrow of the femur and the interior of other large bones,
      such as the ileum, forms blood cells.</p>
    <p>Spongy bone reduces the density of bone and allows the ends of
      long bones to compress as the result of stresses applied to the
      bone. Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not
      heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions.
      The epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject
      to stress from many directions. Imagine laying a heavy framed
      picture flat on the floor. You could hold up one side of the
      picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the
      floor and the picture. Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick
      into the wall to hang up the picture. In this case, the function
      of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the
      picture to the wall. The force on the picture is straight down to
      the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire
      pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up.
      The toothpick will break off right at the wall.</p>
    <p>The neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the
      wall. The weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but
      the vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end.
      The neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer the
      downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical
      shaft of the femur (<a href="ch38.html#m44789-fig-ch38_02_05"

        side of the tension lines." width="400" height="386"></p>

    <h2 id="m44786">Joints and Skeletal Movement</h2>
    <p>The point at which two or more bones meet is called a <em>joint</em>,
      or <em>articulation</em>. Joints are responsible for movement,
      such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the
      stability found in the bones of the skull.</p>
    <h3 id="m44786-fs-idp156819008">Classification of Joints on the
      Basis of Structure</h3>
    <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <p>There are two ways to classify joints: based on their structure
      or based on their function. The structural classification divides
      joints into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending
      on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of
      a cavity in the joint. The bones of fibrous joints are held
      together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or
      space, present between the bones, so most fibrous joints do not
      move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. The joints
      between the bones in the skull and between the teeth and the bone
      of their sockets are examples of fibrous joints (<span class="xref
        target-figure">Figure&nbsp;16.16</span><span class="bold"><strong>a</strong></span>).</p>
    <p><span id="m45538-fs-idp114355648"> </span><em class="glossterm"><span
          id="m45538-autoid-cnx2dbk-id962606"> </span>Cartilaginous
        joints</em><a id="id570040" class="indexterm"> are joints in
        which the bones are connected by cartilage (</a><span
        class="xref target-figure">Figure&nbsp;16.16</span><span
        class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>). An example is found at
      the joints between vertebrae, the so-called “disks” of the
      backbone. Cartilaginous joints allow for very little movement.</p>
    <p><span id="m45538-fs-idm1195888"> </span><em class="glossterm"><span
          id="m45538-autoid-cnx2dbk-id962626"> </span>Synovial joints</em><a
        id="id570080" class="indexterm"> are the only joints that have a
        space between the adjoining bones (</a><span class="xref
        target-figure">Figure&nbsp;16.16</span><span class="bold"><strong>c</strong></span>).




      This space is referred to as the joint cavity and is filled with
      fluid. The fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between
      the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones
      are covered with cartilage and the entire joint is surrounded by a
      capsule. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of
      the joint types. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of
      synovial joints.<br>

    <h2 id="m44788">Muscle Contraction and Locomotion</h2>
    Muscle cells are specialized for contraction. Muscles allow for
    motions such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes
    such as respiration and digestion. The body contains three types of
    muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle (<a
      href="ch38.html#m44788-fig-ch38_04_01"

    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_01.jpg" alt="The skeletal muscle
        cells are long and arranged in parallel bands that give the
        appearance of striations. Each cell has a multiple nuclei.

        cell. Cardiac muscles are striated but have only one nucleus."
        width="654" height="158"></p>
    <p>Figure&nbsp;38.33.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle,
      smooth muscle, and cardiac muscle, visualized here using light
      microscopy. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end,
      and have only one plump nucleus in each. Cardiac muscle cells are
      branched and striated, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, and
      they have one nucleus in the center of the cell. (credit:
      modification of work by NCI, NIH; scale-bar data from Matt
      Russell)</p>
    <p><em>Skeletal muscle tissue</em> forms skeletal muscles, which
      attach to bones or skin and control locomotion and any movement
      that can be consciously controlled. Because it can be controlled
      by thought, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle.
      Skeletal muscles are long and cylindrical in appearance; when
      viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or
      striated appearance. The striations are caused by the regular
      arrangement of contractile proteins (actin and myosin). <em>Actin</em>
      is a globular contractile protein that interacts with <em>myosin</em>
      for muscle contraction. Skeletal muscle also has multiple nuclei
      present in a single cell.</p>
    <p><em>Smooth muscle tissue</em> occurs in the walls of hollow
      organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and
      around passages such as the respiratory tract and blood vessels.
      Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control,
      has only one nucleus per cell, is tapered at both ends, and is
      called involuntary muscle.</p>
    <p><em>Cardiac muscle tissue</em> is only found in the heart, and
      cardiac contractions pump blood throughout the body and maintain
      blood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated,
      but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously
      controlled and is called involuntary muscle. It has one nucleus
      per cell, is branched, and is distinguished by the presence of
      intercalated disks.</p>
    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm71421024">Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure</h3>
    <p>Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell. These cells
      are incredibly large, with diameters of up to 100 µm and lengths
      of up to 30 cm. The plasma membrane of a skeletal muscle fiber is
      specialized and called the <em>sarcolemma</em>. The sarcolemma is
      the site of action potential conduction (like the cell membrane of
      neurons), which triggers muscle contraction. Within each muscle
      fiber are <em>myofibrils</em>—long cylindrical structures that
      lie parallel to the muscle fiber. Myofibrils run the entire length
      of the muscle fiber, and because they are only approximately 1.2
      µm in diameter, hundreds to thousands can be found inside one
      muscle fiber. They attach to the sarcolemma at their ends, so that
      as myofibrils shorten, the entire muscle cell contracts (<a

      the sarcolemma with a cytoplasm called the sarcoplasm. A muscle
      fiber is composed of many fibrils, packaged into orderly units.</p>
    <p>The striated appearance of skeletal muscle tissue is a result of
      repeating bands of the proteins actin and myosin that are present
      along the length of myofibrils. Dark A bands and light I bands
      repeat along myofibrils, and the alignment of myofibrils in the
      cell causes the entire cell to appear striated or banded.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each I band has a dense line running vertically through the
      middle called a Z disc or Z line. The Z discs mark the border of
      units called <em>sarcomeres</em>, which are the functional units
      of skeletal muscle. One sarcomere is the space between two
      consecutive Z discs. A myofibril is composed of many sarcomeres
      running along its length, and as the sarcomeres individually
      contract, the myofibrils and muscle cells shorten (<a

    <p>Myofibrils are composed of smaller structures called <em>myofilaments</em>.
      There are two main types of filaments: thick filaments and thin
      filaments. Thick and thin filaments are composed of proteins.
      Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The tail of a
      myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the
      central region of a thick filament near the M line, whereas the
      heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin
      filaments overlap. The primary component of thin filaments is the
      actin protein. <br>

    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm188124656">Sliding Filament Model of
      Contraction</h3>
    <p>For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten.
      However, thick and thin filaments—the components of sarcomeres—do
      not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the
      sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length.
      The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to
      fit the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere
      at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. The
      mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin,
      forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (<a
        href="ch38.html#m44788-fig-ch38_04_04"
        title="Figure&nbsp;38.36.&nbsp;">Figure&nbsp;38.36</a>).</p>
    <p><img src="m44788/Figure_38_04_04.jpg" alt="Part A of the
        illustration shows a relaxed muscle fiber. Two zigzagging Z
        lines extend from top to bottom. Thin actin filaments extend
        left and right from each Z line. Between the Z lines is a
        vertical M line. Thick myosin filaments extend left and right
        from the M line. The thick and thin filaments partially overlap.
        The A band represents the length that the thick filaments extend
        from both sides of the M line. The I band represents the part of
        the thin filaments that does not overlap with the thick
        filaments. Part B shows a contracted muscle fiber. In the
        contracted fiber, the thick and thin filaments completely
        overlap. The A band is the same length as in the uncontracted
        muscle, but the I band has shrunken to the width of the Z line."

    <p>Figure&nbsp;38.36.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer
      together and the I band gets smaller. The A band stays the same
      width and, at full contraction, the thin filaments overlap.</p>
    <p>When a sarcomere shortens, some regions shorten whereas others
      stay the same length. When a muscle contracts, the distance
      between the Z discs is reduced. The H zone—the central region of
      the A zone—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during
      contraction. The I band contains only thin filaments and also
      shortens. The A band does not shorten—it remains the same
      length—but A bands of different sarcomeres move closer together
      during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are
      pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere
      until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of
      overlap, in which thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the
      same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.</p>

      Which is smaller and more numerous (and why)? Myofibrils or

    </p>
    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm31740224">ATP and Muscle Contraction</h3>
    <p>The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to
      actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires energy,
      which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site
      on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site for
      ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing
      an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.</p>
    <p>ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and
      myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly
      bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P<sub>i</sub>.
      The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The
      energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the
      myosin head into a “cocked” (high energy) position. The myosin
      head is then in a position for further movement, possessing
      potential energy, but ADP and P<sub>i</sub> are still attached. If
      actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will
      remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but
      still attached.</p>
    <p>If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will
      form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the
      actin and myosin molecules. P<sub>i</sub> is then released,
      allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational
      change. The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin
      along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move
      approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is called the
      power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. As the
      actin is pulled toward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the
      muscle contracts.</p>
    <p>When the myosin head is “cocked,” it contains energy and is in a
      high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the myosin
      head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power
      stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. After the
      power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is
      still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. ATP can
      then attach to myosin, myosin detaches from actin, which allows
      the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle
      contraction can occur (<a href="ch38.html#m44788-fig-ch38_04_05"

    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idp31333072">Regulatory Proteins</h3>
    <p>When a muscle is in a resting state, actin and myosin are
      separated. To keep actin from binding to the active site on
      myosin, regulatory proteins block the molecular binding sites. <em>Tropomyosin</em>
      blocks myosin binding sites on actin molecules, preventing
      cross-bridge formation and preventing contraction in a muscle
      without nervous input. <em>Troponin</em> binds to tropomyosin and
      helps to position it on the actin molecule; it also binds calcium
      ions.</p>
    <p>To enable a muscle contraction, tropomyosin must change
      conformation, uncovering the myosin-binding site on an actin
      molecule and allowing cross-bridge formation. This can only happen
      in the presence of calcium, which is kept at extremely low
      concentrations in the sarcoplasm. If present, calcium ions bind to
      troponin, causing conformational changes in troponin that allow
      tropomyosin to move away from the myosin binding sites on actin.
      Once the tropomyosin is removed, a cross-bridge can form between
      actin and myosin, triggering contraction. Cross-bridge cycling
      continues until Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and ATP are no longer
      available and tropomyosin again covers the binding sites on actin.</p>
    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm29815056">Excitation–Contraction Coupling</h3>
    <p>Like neuronal cells, muscle cells generate and transmit
      electrical signals. The details of how muscle cells generate and
      transmit action potentials and establish and maintain a resting
      membrane potentials (-70 mv) can (and should) be reviewed in the
      nervous system chapter. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Excitation–contraction coupling is the link (transduction)
      between the action potential generated in the sarcolemma and the
      start of a muscle contraction. The trigger for calcium release
      from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural
      signal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor
      neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to
      the muscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that
      interacts with the neuron is called the <em>motor end plate</em>.
      The end of the neuron’s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and
      it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space
      called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the
      motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the neuron’s
      axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual
      muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.</p>
    <p>Communication occurs between nerves and muscles through
      neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of
      neurotransmitters from the synaptic terminal into the synaptic
      cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and
      bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate. The motor end
      plate possesses junctional folds—folds in the sarcolemma that
      create a large surface area for the neurotransmitter to bind to
      receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to
      allow the passage of Na<sup>+</sup> into the cell when they
      receive neurotransmitter signal.</p>
    <p>Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor
      neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate. Once
      released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the
      synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds with ACh
      receptors. As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open,
      and Na<sup>+</sup> ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell.
      This reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside
      of the cell (depolarization). As ACh binds at the motor end plate,
      this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The
      depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma, creating an
      action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial
      depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open. The
      action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of
      depolarization.</p>
    <p>ACh is broken down by the enzyme <em>acetylcholinesterase</em>
      (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides in the synaptic
      cleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh
      receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction

        released from synaptic vesicles in the axon terminal binds to
        receptors on the muscle cell plasma membrane. Step 2: An action
        potential is initiated that travels down the T tubule. Step 3:
        Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in
        response to the change in voltage. Step 4: Calcium ions bind to
        troponin, exposing active sites on actin. Cross-bridge formation
        occurs and muscles contract. Three additional steps are part of
        the end of a muscle contraction. Step 5: Acetylcholine is
        removed from the synaptic cleft by acetylcholinesterase. Step 6:
        Calcium ions are transported back into the sarcoplasmic
        reticulum. Step 7: Tropomyosin covers active sites on actin

    <h3 id="m44788-fs-idm104729504">Control of Muscle Tension</h3>
    <p>Neural control initiates the formation of actin–myosin
      cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in
      muscle contraction. These contractions extend from the muscle
      fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal
      movement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the
      amount of force created by this tension can vary. This enables the
      same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In
      individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced depends
      on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency
      of neural stimulation.</p>
    <p>The number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin
      determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can produce.
      Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments
      overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-bridges
      are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will
      be produced.</p>
    <p>The ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal
      tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the
      greatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal
      resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the
      greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in
      fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is produced.
      As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the
      thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed of myosin
      tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin
      will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the tension
      produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even
      more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each other—reducing
      cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less
      tension. Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched to the point at
      which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no
      cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. This amount
      of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins,
      internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme
      stretching.</p>
    <p>The primary variable determining force production is the number
      of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action potential
      from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to
      pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only signals a few
      neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In
      vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if stimulated. When
      picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in
      the biceps and every myofiber participates. This is close to the
      maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above,
      increasing the frequency of action potentials (the number of
      signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the
      tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.</p>
