<h2 id="capturing-and-storing-energy">Capturing and Storing energy</h2>
<hr />
<p>Organisms use energy to build complex and unstable biological molecules, maintain their structural organization (for example, maintain chemical gradients across their membranes), and to build copies of themselves.</p>
<p>There are two sources of energy available to organisms: chemical (molecules) and electromagnetic (light).</p>
<p>When you consider molecules, you will realize that biologically useful energy is held in molecular electron orbitals; there are no nuclear reactions going on inside cells.</p>
<p>The structure of a molecule’s electron orbitals determines the amount of energy stored in each electron. When an electron is added to a molecule the energy of the molecule increases and the molecule is said to have been “reduced”.</p>

</figure>
<p>And yes, it does seem weird that adding an electron “reduces” a molecule.</p>
<p>If an electron is removed, the molecule’s energy is lowered and the molecule is said to have been “oxidized”.</p>
<p>Since electrons can neither be created nor destroyed (remember, no nuclear reactions), the reduction of one molecule is always coupled to the oxidation of another. For this reason, reactions of this type are referred to as <a href="http://naio.kcc.hawaii.edu/chemistry/basic_model.html">redox reactions</a>.</p>
<p>There are many compounds in the natural world from which organisms can extract energy. Lithotrophs or <a href="http://www.bact.wisc.edu/microtextbook/Metabolism/lithotrophs.html">rock eaters</a> extract energy from inorganic compounds, such as elemental sulfur (S), molecular hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>).</p>
<p>Most higher organisms (like plants, fungi, and animals) are either phototrophs, which extract energy from light, or chemoorganotrophs, which extract energy from organic molecules. You yourself are a chemoorganotroph.</p>
<p>The larger the change in free energy (ΔG) associated with a reaction, the more energy is released or absorbed when the reaction occurs.</p>
<p>Consider wood, which is mainly composed of the carbohydrate polymer cellulose [C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>]<sub>n</sub></p>
<p>The burning of wood can be written as a chemical reaction. cellulose + O<sub>2</sub> ↔ nCO<sub>2</sub> + nH<sub>2</sub>O</p>
<p><a href="http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/consumer/faq/what-is-cellulose.shtml"><img src="./img/cellulose.gif" alt="Figure: Cellulose is a polymer of glucose (sugar)" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure: Cellulose is a polymer of glucose (sugar)</em></p>
<p>This reaction has a high negative free energy (ΔG), it is exothermic (releases energy to the surroundings.) That means, the energy stored in the bonds of cellulose and O<sub>2</sub> is less than that stored in the bonds of CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O. The difference is released as heat (thermal motion, that is increased kinetic energy).</p>

</figure>
<p>At the same time, the activation energy of this reaction is high, which is why books do not spontaneously burst into flames. While thermodynamically favorable (because ΔG is negative), it does not occur spontaneously (at least if we use the word spontaneously as it is normally used in English).</p>
<p>Once started, however, the energy released during the reaction acts to maintain the reaction – the reaction becomes self-sustaining and continues until the reactants are used up.</p>
<p>In order to be biologically useful, however, highly exothermic reactions must be controlled and the energy released must be captured in a useful form. It is hard for an organism to capture, at the molecular level, the energy of a fire.</p>
<p>To capture energy, cells use step-by step processes. As an example, a molecule of sugar is broken down by a cell in a tightly controlled, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycolysis">step-by-step process</a> known as glycolysis, from the Greek words meaning sweet (glyco) and splitting (lysis).</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/oxidationSugar2.jpg" alt="Figure: Controlled oxidation (burning) of sugar" /><figcaption><em>Figure: Controlled oxidation (burning) of sugar</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The energy released is captured through synthesis of a number of unstable compounds, including ATP.</p>
<p><strong>Questions to answer</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Why is the burning of wood self-sustaining?</li>
<li>Why are oxidation and reduction always coupled?</li>
<li>Why are carbohydrates a good source of energy?</li>
<li>In a typical cell, where do you think the energy released from the oxidation of sugars go?</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<p><strong>Storing energy in molecules and gradients</strong></p>
<p>There are a number of ways that cells store energy. The synthesis of ATP from adenosine diphosphate ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) is the most familiar.</p>
<p>As you (hopefully) appreciate, whenever a bond is formed, energy is released - it always takes energy to break a bond</p>
<p>Generally, the energy required to break bonds comes from the kinetic energy of surrounding molecules (similarly the energy released upon bond formation is often transformed into kinetic energy).</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/bondbreakingandformation.jpg" alt="Figure: Energy bond breaking and formation" /><figcaption><em>Figure: Energy bond breaking and formation</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When we think about a molecule like ATP and energy, we have to consider all of the bonds that are broken and formed in the process.</p>
<p>ATP is typically formed from ADP and Pi. We have to break a number of rather stable bonds in both ADP and Pi to form the new and rather unstable ADP- Pi bond in ATP. [what makes ATP unstable?]</p>
<p>Another class of “high energy/low stability” molecules involves the reduction of certain compounds. For example, the addition of two electrons and a proton to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>) leads to the formation of the high energy/unstable molecule NADH.</p>
<p><img src="./img/NAD.jpg" alt="Figure: NAD is a low energy molecule" />] <img src="./img/NADH.jpg" alt="Figure: NADH is a high energy molecule" />]</p>
<p>Similarly, the addition of two electrons and two protons to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) leads to the formation of FADH<sub>2</sub></p>
<p>Both NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are high energy/unstable compounds, like ATP. When electrons are removed from NAPH or FADH<sub>2</sub>, that is when these molecules are oxidized, this energy is released, and NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD are regenerated.</p>
<p>The energy carried by NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> is used to drive a number of cellular reactions, it can also be used to generate ATP.</p>
<hr />
<p>How does the cell use the energy stored in NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> to make ATP? The answer came from the work of an eccentric British scientist, <a href="http://www.biology.ucsd.edu/%7Emsaier/transport/petermitchell/one.html">Peter Mitchell</a> It is known as the chemiosmotic hypothesis.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nobel.se/chemistry/laureates/1978/mitchell-bio.html"><img src="./img/mitchell.jpg" alt="Figure: Peter Mitchell" /></a></p>
<p><em>Figure: Peter Mitchell, click the image to learn more</em></p>
<p>Mitchell proposed that the energy held in NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> was used to generate a concentration gradient of H<sup>+</sup> across the plasma membrane in bacterial cells.</p>
<p>Electrons, removed from NADH or FADH<sub>2</sub>, pass through an electron transport chain.</p>
<p>The electron transport chain is a set of membrane proteins that interact with one another in pairs of redox reactions.</p>
<p>As high energy electrons move from one component of the electron transport chain to the next, the first is oxidized, the second is reduced, some energy is &quot;bled-off’ and used to pump H<sup>+</sup>s out of the cell, forming an H<sup>+</sup> concentration gradient across the membrane.</p>

<p><em>Tutorial: Watch the tutorial: Electron transport in bacteria &amp; archaea.</em></p>
<p><strong>ATP synthases</strong> consist of two parts, the F<sub>o</sub> membrane channel and the F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase. The ATP synthase mediates a series of coupled reactions. The first is the movement of H<sup>+</sup>s down their concentration gradient (through the ATP synthase).</p>
<p>The ATP synthase couples this thermodynamically favorable reaction with a second reaction, the ADP + Pi ↔ ATP + H<sub>2</sub>O reaction, which is thermodynamically unfavorable.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that there is nothing about this reaction that stops it (under the right conditions) from running backward. When this occurs, the ATP synthase acts as an ATPase and a pump that can move H<sup>+</sup>s against its concentration gradient.</p>

<p><em>Movie: Watch synthase in action!</em></p>
<p>As H<sup>+</sup>s move through the ATP synthase, the molecule rotates, this rotation “forces” ADP + Pi together to form ATP.</p>

<p>This (above) is a higher magnification view of the process, where you can see ADP and Pi binding, ATP formation, and then release.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Back to electrons:</strong> So where do the electrons end up? They have to go somewhere!</p>
<p>O<sub>2</sub> is a very efficient oxidizer, that is, an acceptor of electrons from other molecules. In the presence of O<sub>2</sub> and an electron transport chain, NADH and FADH<sub>2</sub> are oxidized to form NAD<sup>+</sup> and FADH (they are recycled).</p>
<p>The electrons pass through the electron transport chain, as they move H<sup>+</sup>s are moved across the membrane to form a H<sup>+</sup> gradient.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/respire.gif" alt="Figure: Aerobic respiration" /><figcaption><em>Figure: Aerobic respiration</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Eventually four of these electrons (and four H<sup>+</sup>s) are added to two O<sub>2</sub>s, creating two water molecules. Again this is a thermodynamically favorable reaction.</p>
<p>Under aerobic conditions (that is in the presence of O<sub>2</sub>), glucose can be broken down completely to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O; much (~60%) of the energy originally present in the glucose molecule is captured as ATP (what happens to the rest?)</p>
<p>In the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, that is under anaerobic conditions, the breakdown of pyruvate to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O cannot occur - the energy in pyruvate is unavailable to the cell.</p>
<figure>
<img src="./img/anaerobic.gif" alt="Figure: Anaerobic respiration" /><figcaption><em>Figure: Anaerobic respiration</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The cell contains limited amounts of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH (can you imagine why?)</p>
<p>In order for a cell to continue to metabolize glucose, it must regenerate its NAD<sup>+</sup>. In the absence of O<sub>2</sub>, the regeneration of NAD<sup>+</sup> involves the oxidation of NADH by pyruvate.</p>
<p>Most of the energy present in the glucose molecule is still present in products of this reaction; only about 6% of the energy present in glucose is captured in the absence of molecular oxygen.</p>
