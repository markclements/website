##4. Evolution’s logic

* * * * *

As stated clearly by the Englishman Thomas Malthus (1766-1834), organisms are capable 
of explosive, exponential increases in numbers.

[A single pair of
elephants](http://www.idlex.freeserve.co.uk/idle/evolution/sex/elephant.html),
breeding in a unlimited manner, and living a normal life-span, would
produce \~15,000,000 living descendents at the end of 500 years.

At this rate, it would not take long for the progeny of our original
pair of elephants to produce a mass of descendants larger than that of
the earth.

Obviously, exponential growth cannot go on forever, or even for very
long.

The total number of organisms at any one time is limited by the
resources available (space and food) as well as by predators and disease
and, in the case of higher organisms, social factors such as
territoriality
[[link](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal))][[link](https://iriss.stanford.edu/sites/all/files/shared/documents/Lopez-Sepulcre2005.pdf)].

In an unperturbed system, population numbers generally oscillate around
a steady state (although because of ecological and evolutionary
interactions, these steady states may not be completely stable.)

The human population is an interesting example of a system that has
escaped one steady state and has yet to find another.

The graph above displays three scenarios of human population growth,
based on different levels of average fertility. In a number of
countries, the birth rate already falls into the low fertility domain
[[link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezVk1ahRF78)]. 

This decrease in birth rate per women correlates with **reductions** in
infant mortality and increases in the educational level of women. The
behavior of humans appears to be somewhat different from that of your
“average” animal, plant, or microbe.

**Darwin & Wallace: recognizing the significance of genetic variation**

In 1858, Charles Darwin and Alfred Wallace published their observations
and proposed their idea of evolution by natural selection. Their ideas
were based on an apparently simple observation, namely that individual
organisms in a population are not identical and that part of this
variation is inherited. 

If all of the offspring were identical, which ones would survive to
reproduce would be a matter of luck, pure and simple.  If variation is
due to genetic factors, and if variation influences reproductive
success, then populations will, of necessity, change (evolve) over
time. 

![*Figure: Phenotypic variation in snail shells*](./img/Snail_Shell_Variation.gif)\

Genetic variation has been exploited by plant and animal breeders for
thousands of years to generate the various forms of domesticated plants
and animals. The process is known as [artificial
selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_selection). 

In artificial selection, the breeder selects the animals with the traits
they desire - the offspring that have these traits are mated, those that
do not are destroyed.

Over generations organisms with highly exaggerated forms of desired
traits can be created. 

These organisms may also have other, less desirable traits, which can
themselves be the focus of artificial selection (if deemed worthwhile). 
Because they live in an artificial environment (a farm or as pets), many
of these traits can be tolerated, even though they would be quickly
selected against in the wild.

During the last century, the mechanisms of heredity have been largely
resolved. Genetic information is stored in molecules of DNA. The total
genetic information stored in an organism’s DNA is its genotype.  This
information is read out, through the processes of transcription and
translation, to form macromolecules (RNAs and proteins). These
macromolecules are major building blocks of cells, and regulate cellular
behavior, tissue and organ formation and organismic behavior.  

DNA also encodes a second type of information that is involved in
determining where, when and how much a gene is expressed, that is, where
and when the information the gene encodes is used. Gene expression is
regulated by gene products (interacting with DNA sequences) as well as
the way the DNA is packaged. Variation in gene expression due to
variations in gene packaging is the subject of epigenetics.

Changes in genotype, as well as epigenetic factors, can lead to changes
in phenotype, the appearance or behavior of an organism.  An organism’s
phenotype can have dramatic effects on its reproductive success, that
is, how many viable offspring it produces. In evolutioanry terms, the number of viable offspring is a 
measure of the fitness of an organism.

* * * * *

**Mutations and inherited variation**

The molecular replication of genetic material is never quite perfect. 
Complete accuracy requires a very high level of energy expenditure and
effort, resources that can often be more profitably used for other
tasks.

Consider proof-reading one of your own term papers. If you earn an “A”
even if your paper has a few minor grammatical errors in it, is it worth
spending extra hours finding and correcting everyone of those errors?

![*Figure: A family tree*](./img/family1.gif)

In addition to mutations that occur during replication, DNA molecules
can undergo various types of changes, including duplications, deletions,
or rearrangements, that change genotype and phenotype.

An important point, which we will return to, is that all of these
various types of mutations occur randomly; there is no known mechanism
by which the environment (or the organism) can influence which mutations
occur. This is sometimes known as the central dogma of molecular
biology.

Although it might seem unlikely, mutations can be useful to a
population, if not to a particular individual.  Mutations produce
genetic and phenotypic variation.

Because of mutations (and sex) offspring are genetically distinct from
one another and from their parents. With each generation, the population
of organisms accumulates more and more different mutations - more and
more genetic variation.  A similar process occurs during the development
and maintenance of an organism (different cells in the body can have
different genotypes) and such differences can lead to disease, most
dramatically, to cancer. 

Sometimes the phenotypic differences associated with a particular
genotype are subtle, other times dramatic. Most phenotypes are due to
the action of many genes, acting together, but some arise from
variations in a single gene. Different versions of a gene are known as
**alleles** of that gene. 

Consider this baby (below), born with a mutation in the gene encoding the
protein myostatin. It has a mutated myostatin allele. 

[![](./img/musclebaby.jpg)](http://fig.cox.miami.edu/%7Ecmallery/150/neuro/myostatin.htm)

Myostatin normally acts to suppress the growth of muscle; when myostatin
activity is reduced, muscles grow bigger. 

Mutations in the
*[myostatin](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=601788)*
gene lead to either reduced levels or altered forms of the myostatin
protein. In humans, a reduced level of myostatin activity causes a child
to have muscles that are twice the size of those in a normal child,
without exercise!

In cattle (below), a mutation in the *myostatin* gene is responsible for the
“double muscle” phenotype displayed by some breeds.

[![myostatin](./img/double_muscle_mutation.jpg)](http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=24998)

On the other hand, over-expression of myostatin leads to the loss of
muscle observed in [AIDS wasting
syndrome](http://www.aids.org/factSheets/519-Wasting-Syndrome.html).

* * * * *

**Questions to answer**

1.  What factors will lead to a new steady state level in the human
    population?
2.  Make of list of the possible benefits and disadvantages of having an
    altered myostatin protein.
3.  Make a model by which the accumulation of mutations can be used to
    determine the relationship between organisms.

**Questions to ponder**

-   What limits the extent to which a trait can be selected?
-   The products of artificial selection rarely compete well with
    “native” species; why might that be?

**Evolution by Natural Selection:**

We might hope for a world of peace, where the lion sits down with the
lamb, rather than attempting to eat it.

![*Figure:The peaceable kingdom by Edward Hicks
 (1780-1849)*](./img/peaceableKindgom.jpg)

In the real (natural) world, however, there is almost constant stress
due to the presence of predators, pathogens, the search for food, mates
and places to live.  

These combine to produce a “natural selection” for those organisms that
reproduce most successfully, that is those that produce the most offspring that
themselves also reproduce (remember our definition of fitness). 

Organisms with different phenotypes can differ in their reproductive
success in a particular environment.

Over time, the genotypes of the organisms that are the most
reproductively successful (the most fit) within a particular environment will become
more common within the population. 

These genotypes will be selected based on their effects on phenotype,
and the phenotype’s impact on the organism’s reproductive success.
Genotypes that decrease an organism’s reproductive success compared to
other organisms in the population will be selected against and may
disappear altogether. Over generations, this process leads to adaptation
of organisms to their particular environments or to their extinction. 

**What is an organism’s environment?** 

This is a complex question. The answer is determined by the organism’s
life-style.  

Which parts of the environment matter, in terms of reproductive success
(the only thing that natural selection “cares” about), can be quite
specific. Organisms can, and often do, avoid competition with other
organisms by adapting to very specific and distinct environments and
life-styles, often referred to as an [ecological
niche](http://www.purchon.com/ecology/niche.htm). There is a principle
in evolutionary biology, known as the [competitive exclusion
principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_exclusion_principle)
or Gause’s law, that two species cannot (stably) occupy the same
ecological niche.

* * * * *

> Some organisms are amazingly specialized. Perhaps the narrowest ecologic
niche of all is that of a species of the fungus family Laboulbeniaceae,
which grows exclusively on the rear portion of the elytra of the beetle
Aphenops cronei, which is found only in some limestone caves in southern
France. Larvae of the fly Psilopa petrolei develop in seepages of crude
oil in California oilfields; as far as is known they occur nowhere
else. – Th. Dobzhansky.

* * * * *

An organism adapted to a particular niche may be more successful than an
organism adapted to the general environment.  At the same time, as an
organism becomes better and better adapted to a specific niche, it
becomes more and more dependent on the continued existence of that niche
for its survival, if the niche disappears the species is also likely to
become extinct.

It is worth noting that evolution is a dynamic process, changes in a
population may change selective pressures, that is, which traits are
favored.  The full complexities of evolutionary processes are clearly
beyond this introductory course (You might consider taking my other course, BIO 112!).

**Adaptation is rarely perfect. **

What evolution can produce is constrained by a number of factors, most
importantly the current state of the population. This includes those
genotypes already present. Not all phenotypes are accessible from a
particular genotype, and even if they are, the cost of attaining
“perfection” (if there is such a thing), may not be repaid by the
reproductive advantage it provides.

Our ability to choke on food could be considered a serious design flaw, but it reflects 
the evolutionary path that produced us (and other four legged creatures), a path that 
led to the crossing of our upper airway (leading to the lungs) and our pharynx 
(leading to our gastrointestinal systems. That is why food can lodge in the airway, causing choking or death. 

It is possible that the costs of a particular “imperfect” design are
offset by other advantages. For example, the small but significant
possibility of death by choking may, in an evolutionary sense, be worth
the ability to make more complex sounds (speech)
[[link](http://www.livescience.com/7468-hyoid-bone-changed-history.html)].
 
[(F. Jacob on evolution & tinkering)](http://virtuallaboratory.colorado.edu/Biofundamentals/lectureNotes/Readings/EvolutionTinkering.pdf)

As a general rule, evolutionary processes generate structures and
behaviors that are as good as they need to be for an organism to
effectively exploit a specific set of environmental resources and to
compete effectively with its neighbors.

If being better than “good enough” does not enhance reproductive
success, it will not be selected for, and variations in that direction
will be lost, particularly if they come at the expense of other
important processes or abilities. 

We see the evidence for the “good enough” character of evolutionary
processes all around us. It explains the limitations of our senses, as
well as our tendency to get backaches, need hip-replacements, and our
susceptibility to diseases and aging
[[link](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/what-evidence-suggests.html)]. \

For example, the design of our eyes leaves a blind spot in the
retina. Complex eyes have arisen a number of times during the history of
life, apparently independently, and not all have a blind spot.

We have adapted to this retinal blind spot through the use of [saccadic
movements](http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=33195)
- why, because this is an evolutionarily easier fix to the problem than
rebuilding the eye from scratch (which is essentially impossible). 

An “intelligently designed” human eye would presumably not have such an
obvious design flaw.

*Figure: Vertebrate (left) and invertebrate eyes (right)*

Over time, organisms that diverge from the optimal rather than the best,
however imperfect, solution will be at a selective disadvantage. This
process of maintaining an already optimal design is known as
**conservative** selection (which we will discuss further later on)..

[Anti-evolution arguments (and scientific responses)](http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/list.html)

The theory of evolution has been controversial since its inception
because it deals with issues of human behavior and origins, our place in
the universe, life and its meaning. Its implications can be quite
disconcerting
[[link](http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/asbmbtoday_article_print.aspx?id=13071)]. \

[![](./img/tenents.jpg)](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/slacktivist/2012/06/20/creationism-requires-a-global-conspiracy-of-lying-scientists-andor-a-lying-god/)

Some people are confused and assume that the goal of science is to
provide truth. This is an unwarranted assumption – the **TRUTH**
about the universe may well be unknowable or incomprehensible to us. 

That said, science, based on the assumption of naturalism and the
process of prediction, validation, and revision, has proven to be quite
effective at dealing with a wide range of practical problems, from
weather prediction to curing disease.

It provides a method to understand, and often manipulate the world to
our benefit. 

What does that mean in practice – it means that children who would
otherwise die of bacterial or viral infections live; that crop yields
can be increased and fewer people starve; that pesticide use can be
reduced through genetic engineering; that people can communicate with
one another through satellite-transmitted signals; and that much of what happens 
in the world around us can be understood in a logical and ever more complete 
and accurate manner.

**Questions to answer**

1.  Compare modern human behavior with the behavior of our ancestors,
    would similar traits be selected?
2.  How would you describe the difference between optimal and perfect?
3.  Why don’t we all have mutations that lower the activity of the
    myostatin gene?

**Questions to ponder**

-   Consider a specific trait; what limits its perfectibility?
-   If there was a commercially available myostatin inhibitor, should
    parents be allowed to give it to their children (why or why not)?
